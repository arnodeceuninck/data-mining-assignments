-hou	-hou is a suffix (part added to the end of a word) found in many Channel Islands and Normandy names. It is the Norman language version of the Old Norse language holmr, meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as "holm". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm. The Norman hommet/houmet also comes from this suffix. In French language, the equivalent is îlot, which is the same as the English "islet".
.htaccess	.htaccess is a type of computer file for the configuring of some server. .htaccess files can be used to create custom error pages, or to prevent visitors from directly linking pictures, also known as hotlinking to their own sites, costing the website owner bandwidth and therefore money.
16-cell	In four dimensional geometry, a 16-cell, is a regular convex polychora, or polytope existing in four dimensions. It is also known as the hexadecachoron. It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. John Horton Conway calls it an orthoplex for orthant complex, as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.
2007 Universal Forum of Cultures	The Universal Forum of Cultures Monterrey 2007 is an international civil-society event that will take place in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. It begins in September and ends in December. The Forum, as it is called often, is a global event which takes place every 3 years, in a different city each time. Its purpose is to unite citizens from a varied range of cultures, languages, religions for inter-cultural dialogue. This massive event will gather an approximate 1.5 million visitors to Monterrey, and is mostly free of charge.
20th century in literature	Literature of the 20th century refers to world literature produced during 1900 through the 1990s. The best-selling works of the 20th century are thought to be Quotations from Chairman Mao (1966, 900 million copies), Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997, 120 million copies), And Then There Were None (1939, 115 million copies) and The Lord of the Rings (1954/55, 100 million copies). The Lord of the Rings was also voted "book of the century" in various surveys. Perry Rhodan (1961 to present) boasts as being the best-selling book series, with an estimated total of 1 billion copies sold.
3D projection	A 3D projection is a way of showing a 3D environment on a 2D flat surface or screen. A projection is usually calculated using complex mathematical equations.
4-H	4-H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development." The name represents four personal development areas for the organization's members: head, heart, hands, and health. The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs. The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs. Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications. The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").
4D	4D, meaning the common 4 dimensions, is a concept in mathematics. It has been studied by mathematicians and philosophers since the 18th century. Mathematicians who studied four-dimension space in the 19th century include Möbius, Schläfi, Bernhard Riemann, and Charles Howard Hinton. In geometry, the fourth dimension is related to the other three dimensions of length, width, and depth by imagining another direction through space. Just as the dimension of depth can be added to a square to create a cube, a fourth dimension can be added to a cube to create a tesseract. 4D is also an important idea in physics, developed in the 20th century. In physics, it refers to the idea of time as a fourth dimension, added to the (3D) spatial dimensions. Albert Einstein developed the idea of spacetime by connecting space and time together. The difference is that spacetime is not a Euclidean space, but instead is called "Minkowski spacetime".
A Sound of Thunder	"A Sound of Thunder" is a short story by Ray Bradbury. It was first published in 1952 in Collier's magazine. "A Sound of Thunder" is a science fiction story with time travel.
APEX flight academy	The APEX flight academy based in Taitung Airport, Taiwan, is a flight school started in 2014. Known because it is the first and only school approved by the Civil Aviation Authority in Taiwan. It has aircrafts and flight simulators. In 2018, the school signed an partnership deal with the French Civil Aviation University to conduct European Aviation Safety Agency certified trainings.
ARP Spoofing	ARP Spoofing is a method someone (such as a hacker) could use to redirect traffic from a computer through the hacker's computer and then to the internet. This allows the hacker to then read all traffic sent from or to the first computer. This will reveal passwords, credit card numbers, and other private information. A symptom of this sort of attack is a window when browsing to a secure site that says something along the lines of "This website's authentication check has failed". This means that the hacker has forged a secure connection that cannot be verified. So, the warning is presented.
ARPANET	The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet switching network and the first to use TCP/IP. It was made by the DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. It was the main network of a set that came to make up the global Internet.
Aarti	Aarti also spelled arti, arati, arathi, aarthi (In Devanagari: ) is a Hindu Religion ritual. Worshippers offer light to the gods or goddess and sing praise to them.
Abduction	Abduction is the criminal act of taking a person away by means of fraud, persuasion, by threat of violence or by force. Kidnapping, by comparison, is limited to a threat of violence or taking adults or the by the taking of children. But in most jurisdictions they are separate crimes. Unlawful with family members such as removing a child from its parents is abduction.<ref name=USLegal/> It does not matter if the minor (law) consents or not. Kidnapping is the unlawful taking of a person against their Free will.<ref name=USLegal/> Abduction can also mean the taking of any female person for the purposes of prostitution, concubinage or (forced) marriage.<ref name=Farlex/>
Abnormal psychology	Abnormal psychology is a part of psychology. People who study abnormal psychology are psychologists. They are scientists that investigate the mind using the scientific method. Different cultures tend to have different ideas of how strange (abnormal) any behaviour is considered. This tends to change over time within cultures, so people that live in a country at one time in history might consider abnormal what people who live in the same country consider normal years before or years later. Abnormal psychology is often used to understand or to treat people with mental disorders to make life better for them. This is because abnormal behaviour is often defined as when someone is not able to change how they behave to fit different settings. This is often also used to define some mental disorders. When someone cannot change their behaviour to fit the people and situations around them when they need to, it can cause suffering, and the person may be uncomfortable when around people. Their behaviour can be unreasonable and hard to understand. Their behaviour can even be dangerous. Not everyone with a mental disorder is unable to adjust to their surroundings. People who can change to fit their the environment around them more easily than most people can also have behaviour that is considered abnormal and might also have an easier life with the help of a psychologist.
Aboriginal title	Aboriginal title is a common law doctrine that the rights of indigenous peoples to own their Homeland persist after sovereignty has been taken by Colonialism settlers. When granted, it is usually Alienation (property law), meaning it can not be sold, traded or given away. The title may be held by individuals or groups of people, and is Inheritance indefinitely (without end) by those people's descendants. What proof is required for aboriginal title to be recognised depends on the country's laws that govern the doctrine. It usually must include some evidence of historical (living on the land for a long time, usually since before colonial settlement). The majority of court cases granting aboriginal title have been in Aboriginal land rights in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United States. Aboriginal title is also referred to as indigenous title, native title and customary title. It is related to the subject of indigenous rights.
Abstract photography	In most cases, photography is about taking pictures of objects or scenes that can directly be recognised. This is done as a way to document things, or to do a portrait, for example. Abstract photography focuses on details, or on the way light is used. As a result, the object that is photographed can no longer be recognised easily. An abstract photograph often only shows a part of a natural scene. The viewer no longer has information about the context. That way, it may create a view that looks unreal. Very often color, light, shadow, texture, shape or form are used to give a feeling, sensation or impression. The image may be produced using traditional photographic equipment like a camera, darkroom or computer, or it may be created without using a camera by directly manipulating Photographic film, paper or other photographic media, including digital presentations.
Abstraction (art)	Abstraction in art history is when art depicts something without caring what it actually looks like.
Academic art	Academic art was an artistic style that was popular from the 17th to the 19th century. Different art schools laid down rules on what a good painting or artwork shouls look like. Academic art was influenced by these rules, and was about applying them when creating a work of art. Academic art is a form of Realism in art. One of the main ideas that influenced academic art was that of Aristotle: A work of art should give a selective, but true copy of a part of reality. This idea was transformed into the concept of mimesis, or imitation. Together with thisidea, there were a number of subjects that were acceptable for painting or sculpture. Very often, the subjects came from mythology The École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France had a lot of influence on the movement. At the time Neoclassicism and Romanticism were the main movements at the school. With later art styles, especially that of impressionism, academic art losts its importance. Well known artists who painted in the academic art style include William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Eugene de Blaas, Edward Poynter, Wilhelm Bendz and Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov.
Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile	The Académie internationale Mohammed VI de l'aviation civile (AIMAC, in English International Academy Mohammed VI of Civil Aviation) is a public aviation university created in 2000 by the King Mohammed VI of Morocco for aerospace education in this country, like Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel training.
Accent	An accent is the way a person speaks. Some people words differently. A lot of the time, different Country that speak the same language pronounce the same words in a different way. Usually they can understand each-other, but they will that they sound a little different. Sometimes, people will talk about someone's accent. They might say that the person has a German language accent, or an Australian accent. An accent is Pronunciation. If you notice someone has (for example) a British English, you can understand them (you know what they are saying), but also know they came from United Kingdom. The way a person says words usually comes from where the person was a child (where they "", or their "") and the other people where the person lives. People learn how to say words and sentences and so they sound the same people near them when they speak. People speaking the same language can have different accents. Even people in the same country can have different accents. Sometimes people can tell what city someone lived in when they were a child by the way that person speaks. One example is a New York City accent. They might say "bwoll" () instead of ball (normally in United States), like used in sports and games; or they might say "hwot dwog" () instead of hot dog (normally or in that country). It sounds different, but people still know they mean "ball" or "hot dog" when they're talking. When first trying to learn a new language, often a person will still have the old accent from their first language. That often allows other people to guess which country or place that person lived in before. If someone can learn another language well enough, someone may not have the old accent anymore and may get a new accent in the new language. If someone studied German language in Austria, for example, people in Germany may think that person was Austrian. Sometimes it can be confusing for people learning a language if there are more than one common accents. If you're learning English but hear a mix of British, American, Canadians and Australian people and people from Singapore and India often, like in your school or on the Internet, it might confuse you when you hear them say the same sounds or words differently. Sometimes, people think it's better to learn the language with one accent so you can be less confused, and when you're good enough at the language, you can start to tell the different accents different people from different countries have.
Accounting software	Accounting software is a program that can run on a computer to track the total value of a company. Accounting software can be downloaded to a computer or can be used through a Web browser window by logging into a website. Before computers all Accountancy information was stored in books called "ledgers". A general ledger was the book where the accountant wrote down all payments that came into a company and all payments that were made. A common term for keeping track of this information is called "keeping the books". A bookkeeper is another term for an accountant, but can sometimes means a person who does accounting but maybe doesn't have as much formal education as an accountant. Accounting software can automate many of the more menial tasks of accounting. For example, many accounting software companies automatically pull in bank information. Instead of having to put in the payments made and cashed received, the program does it for you.
Acoustic music	Acoustic music is music which is played by using acoustic musical instruments, i.e. instruments in which the sound is not made louder by electronic amplification. Before Electronic music were created in the 20th century all instruments were acoustic. Classical music is usually played using only acoustic musical instruments, although some 20th century composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen used electronic instruments, sometimes together with acoustic instruments.
Acquittal	An acquittal is a judgement or verdict that a person is not guilty of the crime with which they have been charged.
Acronis	Acronis Inc. is an United States software company. Its main products are hard disk software. These include disk-imaging backup and recovery, Partition manager, boot management, and data migration software. It also develops software for virtualization migration and conversion for purpose of migrating a physical server to a virtual server (such as VMware), or what is also termed Physical-to-Virtual. Its best-known product is Acronis True Image, which allows a software image of a computer to be made and which can be reinstalled on the same or another computer. Most software is produced in different versions starting at low-priced software for single computers up to versions for companies with many desktop and server computers. Acronis' headquarters are in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA with additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. Walter Scott, who formerly ran Imceda Corporation until its sale to Quest Software, became CEO in 2005. Acronis has taken venture funding from New York private equity and venture capital firm Insight Venture Partners.
Acronis True Image	Acronis True Image is a program to make disk images. It is made by Acronis. True Image can create an disk image of a disk while it is running Microsoft Windows or Linux, or offline by booting from Compact disc/DVD, USB flash drives, Preboot Execution Environment, or other bootable media. As a disk imaging solution, True Image can restore the previously captured image to another disk, effectively replicating the structure and contents to the new disk, also allowing partition resizing if the new disk is of different capacity.
Act of Parliament	An Act of Parliament or Act is law made by the parliament (see legislation).
Active Worlds	Active Worlds (AW) is a 3D computer graphics virtual reality platform. The "Active Worlds Browser" runs on Microsoft Windows. Users assign themselves a user name, log into the Active Worlds virtual world universe, and explore 3D virtual worlds and environments that other users have created. Users can chat with one another or build structures and areas from a selection of objects. AW allows users to own worlds and universes, and develop 3D content.
Adaptation	Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology. When people speak about adaptation, they often mean a 'feature' (a Trait (biology)) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' tooth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the process of the process of adaptation. The illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life. However, eating a different food also means having a different digestive system, gut, claws, wings and above all, different Heredity behaviour. For the major adaptations, what changes is not a single trait, but a whole group of features. Adaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change.
Adaptive unconscious	The adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making. It is different from conscious processing: it is faster, effortless, more focused on the present, but less flexible. It can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view. In some theories of the mind, the unconscious is limited to "low-level" activity, such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously. In contrast, the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in "high-level" cognition such as goal-setting as well. The term 'adaptive unconscious' suggests it has value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly natural selection in the past. Indeed, for much of vertebrate evolution, all mental activity was unconscious. No-one supposes that fish have consciousness. Thus our consciousness is added to an already-existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us.<ref name=Tim/>p23
Addiction	Addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right. When you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict. People can be addicted to drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and many other things. When somebody is addicted to something, they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to. But taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health. Some people who are addicts need to go to a Medical doctor or hospital to cure the addiction, so they no longer crave (want or need) the drug. Addiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body. The blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain, and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it; then they want more of that substance. This takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine; but all of them control the consumer. Once under this control, the consumer does not have a completely free will, and listens to the addiction's bidding. People can also be addicted to other things which are not drugs. You may hear people talk about being "addicted to the Internet" or "addicted to chocolate" or gambling. This means that they get into a habit of enjoying that thing, so if they have to go without it for a while, they miss it a lot. Addiction is similar to a major disease like chronic heart disease or perhaps diabetes, but addictions are not taken as seriously as these major diseases. Most people believe addiction to be a lifestyle choice, which in fact it is but it is also part of a person's genetics. While some people can do things and control themselves others cannot due to their genetic makeup. There are ways of helping the addict but this takes the admission of a problem and then proper testing to reveal what kind of treatment is needed. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences. Prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases.
Additive	In chemistry, an additive is a substance that is added to a mixture or Chemical compound to change the properties of that mixture or compound. Food additives are used to improve food.
Adjacent	Adjacent is an adjective meaning next to. In geometry, two sides that meet to create an angle are said to be adjacent. In trigonometry the adjacent side of a right triangle is the side next to the angle in question.
Administrative law	Administrative law (also called regulatory law) covers a wide range of procedures by Agency. These agencies include city, county, state or [[Wikt:federal|federal]] government . They may be called [[Wikt:commission|commission]]s, [[Wikt:department|department]]s, Division (organisation) or boards. Each may have its own rules and s which are usually not found in statutes.<ref name=HGLaw/> These are based on laws passed by a government. Agencies also have the power to enforce these rules and regulations.<ref name=HGLaw/>
Administrator	Administrators are people who organize things like businesses. All businesses have administrators. They make decisions, organize the people who work there and make sure that things are working alright and there are no problems. Their work is called "administration". The administrators are part of the "management". An administrator is also the person in charge of some of the small territories of the United Kingdom, for example Ascension Island and the British Antarctic Territory which are too small to run their own government.
Adobe Flash	Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash) was a rich internet application distributed by Adobe Systems. Adobe Flash and Adobe Flash Player were used to create and view animation content that could be placed on web pages. Adobe Flash was used commonly on the Internet by web browsers. Flash was created by FutureWave (a multimedia company) in 1995. Then it was called "FutureSplash Animator" (this was in fact Flash 1.0). FutureWave along with Flash were soon bought by Macromedia around 1997, who in December 2005 was again bought by Adobe Systems. From Flash version 2 to 8 it was called "Macromedia Flash", now it is called "Adobe Flash". In 2012, Adobe discontinued the Solaris (operating system) version of Flash Player, and made the Linux version only for Google Chrome. The Android (operating system) version was removed from Google Play. In 2020, Adobe discontinued Adobe Flash, because of security issues.
Advanced Encryption Standard	In cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is a Symmetric-key algorithm, block cipher algorithm that was selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001. It was selected for Encryption data. It is commonly used around the world. The Advanced Encryption Standard has replaced the Data Encryption Standard (DES). As of 2008, AES is one of the most popular algorithms used in Symmetric-key algorithm. It is available to programmers and the general public with various software packages.
Adversarial system	The adversarial system or adversary system is a Law used in the common law countries. It is a system where two advocates represent their parties' positions before an person or group of people. This is usually a jury or judge who attempt to determine the truth of the Legal case. It is in contrast to the inquisitorial system used in some civil law (legal system) systems (i.e. those deriving from Roman law or the Napoleonic code). This is where a judge or group of judges opens an official inquiry and decides the case. The adversarial system is the two-part system under which criminal law courts operate. On one side is the prosecution who usually represents the government. The other side is the defense who represents the defendant. Each party may call witnesses and ask questions. For example, legal ethics prevent a lawyer from calling a witness they know will lie on the court.<ref name=Jonakait185/> Justice is served when the most effective is able to convince the jury or judge that his or her case is the correct one.<ref name=Neubauer28/>
Advice (constitutional)	In constitutional law, Advice is formal, usually binding instruction given by a constitutional officer of state to another. Head of State in particular act on the basis of Advice issued by governments and Prime Minister. For example, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom formally appoints Minister on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
Adware	Adware is an advertising computer program that can be put there by other people on someone's computer, sometimes without their permission. It is because sometimes businesses put the program there so they can see what people are doing or what web pages they are browse. They then put an advertisement that is of the same as the web-page the person is looking at. This can be good if the person is trying to buy something, but many people do not want advertisements. Many people also do not want other people to find out what they are doing or what web pages they are looking at. An example is in the popular peer-to-peer file sharing program, Kazaa. When someone downloads it, it installs adware on their computer that then sends advertisements to the computer. Some people do not like this so they use an illegally changed version of this program called Kazaa Lite.
AeronautX Luftfahrtschule	AeronautX Luftfahrtschule is a flight school located in Linz, Austria. It has been created in 1998.It is well known for its partnership with the airline FlyNikki. The school is member of the International Association of Aviation Personnel Schools.
Aeronautics	Aeronautics is the study of how to make and use flying machines like aeroplanes or helicopters. The name comes from the Ancient Greek language. It means "Air Navigating". Part of aeronautics is Aerodynamics, how air moves around things. Many books are available on these topics. Aeronautics is related to transport and engineering, and aerodynamics is science.
Aeroscopia	Aeroscopia is a museum in Blagnac, France, close to Toulouse. It was created on 14 January 2015. It has two Concorde aircraft.
Affine symmetric group	Flat, Polygon (like Triangle) or Polyhedron (like Pyramid (geometry)) have only a finite number of Symmetry. In contrast, the affine symmetric group is a way to Mathematics describe all the symmetries possible when an Plane (mathematics) is covered by Tessellation. As with many subjects in mathematics, it can also be thought of in a number ways: for example, it also describes the symmetries of the infinitely long number line, or the possible arrangements of all integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) with certain Permutation. As a result, studying the affine symmetric group extends the study of symmetries of polyhedra or of groups of permutations to the Infinity. It also connects several topics in mathematics that were originally studied for independent reasons, ranging from complex reflection groups to Juggling.
African art	African art is art made in Africa or by Africans. Although the term itself is debatable, as there are few other continents whose art is grouped in this way, and given the differences between individual countries within Africa, historically art from Africa has often been considered in this way.
Age of consent	The age of consent is the age at which a person can legally to have sexual intercourse. This is also the age of the other person legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. Having sex with a person who is younger than the age of consent (but who agrees to have sex) is called statutory rape. The person below the minimum age is regarded as a victim, and their sex partner as the . Different countries have different laws regarding the age of consent. Some are as low as 12 or as high as 21. Most countries have ages set between 14 and 16. But worldwide, the average age of consent is 16 years of age.
Agricultural fencing	Agricultural fencing is a type of fence that is often used in agriculture. Fencing is often used to help control livestock on farms. The fence can make sure they do not leave the farm. On farms that grow produce, fencing can be used to keep out wildlife that may eat or damage the crops.
Agronomy	Agronomy is the study of soil in relation to how it affects plant growth. Agronomists work to make methods that will improve the use of soil and increase the amount of food and fiber crops. [[ar:علم الإنتاج النباتي]]
Aiding and abetting	"Aiding and abetting" is a crime. A person is guilty of aiding and abetting if they help someone else commit a crime, and then they do it. Some ways a person can aid and abet a crime are to help someone commit the crime, give someone advice on how to commit the crime, or pay them to commit the crime.
Air France Flight 358	On August 2, 2005, Air France Flight 358 was an Airbus A340 that skidded of the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport, due to the pilots deploying the thrust reversers too slowly. Despite 12 people substantiating injuries, all 309 people on board the plane survived.
Air navigation	Air navigation is navigation while flying. It is used by pilots in aircraft to know their exact position and fond their way. That is important because if they get lost, they can hit a mountain or fly into a dangerous area or not find a place to land. There are generally two types of air navigation depending on weather. In good weather, pilots navigate themselves visually with maps. But when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground, they use special radio navigational instruments or the air traffic controller navigates them. The first kind of navigation is called VFR (visual flight rules) navigation. The second is IFR (instrument flight rules) navigation.
Air show	An air show is an event at which aviators display their flying skills and the capabilities of their aircraft to spectators in aerobatics. Air shows without aerobatic displays, having only aircraft displayed parked on the ground, are called "static air shows".
Air-ground radiotelephone service	Air-ground radiotelephone service is a method of telephone telecommunications used by aircraft pilots and passengers of commercial airline jets flying over the United States.
Airbus Training Centre Europe	Airbus Training Centre Europe is a training centre of the company which make aircrafts Airbus.It is in Blagnac, close to Toulouse (France).The centre trains pilots and engineers on the Airbus aircrafts. It has 6 simulators on all Airbus family. The school is member of the International Association of Aviation Personnel Schools.Other training centres are in Hamburg, Miami, Beijing, Singapore, Bangalore, New Delhi and Mexico.
Airfoil	An airfoil (in American English, or aerofoil in British English) is the shape of a wing, or blade of a propeller, the blade of a ship's screw or the shape of a sail as seen in cross-section. When moving through a fluid it will provide lift (force) and drag. Lift is not only up, it may be in other directions depending on what it is used for.
Ajax (programming)	AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used to make webpages faster to use. If they are programmed with AJAX, they seem to react faster. They only send small bits of information to the server. That way the whole web page does not need to reload, only small parts of it.
Alberto Moioli	Alberto Moioli, (Monza, February 19, 1968), is an Italian art critic and writer, editorial director of the Enciclopedia d'arte italiana from 2012 to 2021.
Alexander Mosaic	The Alexander Mosaic is a Roman floor mosaic from the House of the Faun in Pompeii. It was made in 100 BC. It shows a battle between the armies of Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia. It measures 2.72 x 5.13m (8 ft 11in x 16 ft 9in). The original is at the Naples National Archaeological Museum. The mosaic is based on a 3rd-century BC Hellenistic art painting, by Philoxenos of Eretria. The mosaic shows the Battle of Issus, between Alexander and Darius. Alexander won the Battle of Issus. Alexander won again two years later at the Battle of Gaugamela.
Alice and Bob	Alice and Bob are placeholder names which are commonly used to talk about problems. It is used in cryptography, game theory and physics. Instead of “A sends B a message” people say “Alice sends Bob a message”. Ron Rivest seems to have used these names first, in publications about the RSA algorithm. This was 1977 and 1978.
Alimony	Alimony is the idea that two people who are married are responsible for each other: This also means that if they separate or get Divorce, the financially stronger partner has to pay a sum of money to the financially weaker partner. The origin (or etymology) of the term goes back to Latin, alimentum (which simply means food).
Aliteracy	The problem of aliteracy is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. Teachers and school librarians are trying to deal with this problem.
Alkali	In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous (from water) solution with a pH value of more than 7.The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic language 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products (such as soaps) are made of alkali materials An alkali is where a Base (chemistry) is in water. Often it is the salt of an Alkali metalAn alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid.
All Hail to Massachusetts	"All Hail to Massachusetts" is the anthem of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It was created by Arthur J. Marsh in 1824, and became the official anthem of Massachusetts in 1966.
Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa	Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) is an organization that works in Africa to teach people to farm. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation pay for it. The goernments of the United Kingdom, United States and Germany also gave money. AGRA started in 2006 with one billion U.S. dollars. According to one study, AGRA actually made things worse for farmers in Africa. AGRA gave loans to farmers so they could buy fertilizer, but the farmers could not pay back the loans. AGRA also told people to grow corn (maize), which meant fewer farmers grew traditional African crops. The African crops were stronger against drought. AGRA also asked African governments to pass laws that made things easier for corporations and seed producers, which were bad for small farmers.<ref name=False />
Allotropy	Allotropy (or allotropism) is when a chemical element can exist in two or more different forms in the same physical State of matter. These different forms are called allotropes. Therefore, an allotrope is a different structure in which an element appears. This happens when the atoms of the element are chemical bond together in a different way. For example, the allotropes of carbon include:
AlphaBay	AlphaBay Market was an online Deep Web Market operating on the Tor (anonymity network). It was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice on July 2017.
AlphaGo	AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go. It was made by DeepMind Technologies (Google affiliate). This program became famous due to the victories against professional players. Many new technologies were used to create AlphaGo, including deep learning, optimization, and the Monte Carlo algorithm.
Altarpiece	An altarpiece is a work of art that has been made to go above the altar in a Christianity church. An altarpiece can be a painting, or it can be carved from wood or stone. Some altarpieces have both paintings and sculptures.
Alter ego	An alter ego (from Latin language, "other I") is another self — a second personality within a person. It is also called leading a double life. The term "alter ego" was first used in the 19th century. It was inventory by psychologists in talking about dissociative identity disorder. For example, in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Mr. Hyde was Dr. Jekyll's evil alter ego (same person, different personalities).
Alternator	An alternator is a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current. There is one in every car. Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. The armature reacts to the rotating field and carries the current caused by the rotation. In principle, any alternating current electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators.
Altitude	Altitude means height above the ground or above the sea level. Common uses include aviation (flying, parachuting, gliding), and geography/surveying. In geometry it is also used as the height of the object itself. Generally, altitude is the distance one thing is above another thing. This is in the vertical or "up" direction. For the height of the ground (such as for hills and mountains), the word elevation is also used and might be a better choice. (Mountain climbers usually use the word altitude, especially when talking about how it affects the body). Buildings and other things on the ground usually just use the word height. Vertical distance measurements in the "down" direction are commonly referred to as [[:wikt:depth|depth]].
Amateur astronomy	Amateur astronomy is a hobby where people look at or photograph objects in the sky using their eyes, binoculars, or telescopes They can look at the sky at Night and at daytime. Amateurs can join as members of amateur astronomical societies. These societies advise, educate and guide their members. They promote the science of astronomy among the general public.<ref name="Motta2006"></ref>
Amazon Alexa	Amazon Alexa is a personal assistant made by Amazon (company). It can help users with many tasks, such as basic math, and turning on or off smart lights with Bluetooth. It is similar to Siri (software) and Google Assistant.
Amazon Fire TV	Amazon Fire TV (stylized as amazon fireTV) is a type of digital media player and microconsoles developed by Amazon (company). Dan Seifert from The Verge reviewed Fire TV on April 4, 2014. He gives a 8.8/10 rating and praised its functionality and future potential.
American Institute of Architects	The American Institute of Architects or the AIA is an organization for architects in the United States. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. The AIA offers education, government advice, community redevelopment, and public outreach to support the architecture profession and improve its public image. The AIA also works with other members of the design and construction team to help coordinate the building industry.
American literature	American literature is poetry, fiction, drama, or essays written by Americans. It also includes literature written by people living in the United States (who are not American citizens).
Amount of substance	Amount of substance (also called chemical amount) is a quantity defined by standards to measures the size a group of individual elementary , such as atoms, molecules and electrons, along with other particles. The International System of Units (SI) defines the amount of substance to be equal to the number of elementary entities present. The SI unit for amount of substance is the Mole (unit) (mol). The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains the same number of elementary entities as there are atoms in of the isotope carbon-12. This number is called Avogadro's number and has the value . It is the numerical value of the Avogadro constant which has the unit (or mol), and relates the molar mass of an amount of substance to its mass.
Anal retentive	The words anal-retentive (or anally retentive, anal retentive), often shortened to "anal", are used in everyday language to describe a person with so much attention to detail that the obsession becomes annoying to other people. The idea was thought up by Sigmund Freud
Anal stage	The anal stage is the second stage in Sigmund Freud's psychosexual development theory. Freud believed the personality developed through several stages during childhood. These stages focused on the erogenous zones. The anal stage occurs between ages 18 months to three years. This is the period when a child toilet trains. According to Freud, pleasure is derived from controlling the anus (the primary erogenous zone) and the bladder. A toilet training conflict or fixation results in a rigid or disordered personality.
Analog television	Analog television is broadcasting television programming using analog signals. Before digital television, all broadcasters used analog signals. Analog television can be wireless or can be over a cable television network. Many countries have changed from analog to digital television. Others are in the process of changing, and some have not started changing. The current deadline for "low Electricity" TV stations in the United States to switch to digital television is July 13th 2021, over 60 years after analog was first made. The full power stations already switched in the months between February 12th and July 12th 2009.
Analytic geometry	In classical mathematics, analytic geometry, also known as coordinate geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. As Vector are frequently used, it is also known as vector geometry. In most cases, tools from algebra (especially linear algebra) are used to solve problems.
Analytical psychology	Analytical psychology is the school of psychology that came from the ideas of Swiss psychiatry Carl Jung. Analytical psychology has two main parts:
Anarkali Salwar Suit	An Anarkali Shalwar suit is a form of women's dress. The anarkali suit is made up of a long, frock-style top and features a slim fitted bottom. It is mostly worn by women in Pakistan and other countries in South Asia such as India and Bangladesh. The anarkali suit varies in many different lengths and embroideries including floor length anarkali styles. Anarkali suits owe their name to the fictional Anarkali, a courtesan in the court of Mughal Empire emperor Akbar who was legendarily murdered for her illicit relationship with the Crown Prince Salim.

Ancient Egyptian agriculture	Ancient Egyptian agriculture was probably the first to be practiced on a large scale. They grew staple food crops. These included grains such as emmer (a variety of wheat) and barley. The earliest evidence of irrigation in the Nile area is about 3100 BC. They also grew flax for clothing and oil.<ref name=Lloyd178/> Orchardsand vegetable gardens were also common. Unlike other crops these were grown away from the areas flooded by the Nile each year. It gave work and food for its people. It was a source of wealth for Egypt's . Egypt was the breadbasket (main provider of food) for much of the ancient world.<ref name=Lloyd310/>
Anecdote	An anecdote is a short story someone tells to teach someone else a lesson. Anecdotes can be funny or serious and can sometimes be fiction.
Anger management	Anger management is a Psychotherapy program for anger control. It has been described as using anger successfully.
Angle	When two straight lines come together, they make an angle. The two lines are called the sides of the angle, and they meet at a Point (geometry). A flat surface (called a Plane (mathematics)) also forms an angle when it meets another. To represent an angle, Greek letter such as \alpha (alpha), \beta (beta), \gamma (gamma) and \theta (theta) are sometimes used. An angle indicates the space between its sides, or the amount of rotation needed to make one side coincide the other. To measure the size of an angle, we use Unit of measurements called Degree (geometry). A degree is a standard unit and we use the symbol ° after a number to show that it is a number of degrees. We can use a Decimal or a Fraction (mathematics) for part of a degree, but a degree can also be divided into 60 minutes (1° = 60'), and a minute can be divided into 60 seconds (1' = 60"). So 22.5°, 22° and 22° 30' are all the same angle. In mathematics, angles can also be (and often are) measured in radians instead of degrees, by using the conversion factor 2\pi\mbox = 360^\circ (for example, 22.5^\circ = \tfrac\mbox). Yet another unit of angle is gradian,<ref name=":0" /> with 100 \text = 90^. Angles are studied in geometry, where an angle where edges meet is often called a vertex. For example, the three sides of a triangle are its edges and two of the edges meet at each vertex. Similarly, two of the six sides (or faces) of a cube meet at each of its twelve edges, and three edges meet at each of its eight corners (or , which is the plural version of vertex).
Anglo-Saxon architecture	Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England and parts of Wales, from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066. Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, made from wood with thatch for roofing. There are few remains of Anglo-Saxon architecture. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick.
Anhedonia	In psychology, anhedonia (< Ancient Greek language αν- an-, without + ηδονή hēdonē, pleasure ) is not being able to feel pleasure. This may include not enjoying things like eating, exercise, watching movies, meeting friends, social activities, or sexual interaction and activity. In most cases, anhedonia is caused by mental disorders. It happens in some severe cases of Major depressive disorder and it is a common symptom of schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder and major depressive disorder.
Animal colour	Animal colour (or coloration) is produced by light reflecting from an animal's surface. The ways animals produce colours include pigments, chromatophores and other structures, and bioluminescence. Since sight is usually so important to animals, and is so often used by predators as a long-range way to find prey, an animal's colour must serve one or more functions. These functions, such as finding prey, or evading capture, or finding a mate, are absolutely essential for life and survival. Therefore, animal colour is determined by natural selection because it affects the of animals and their . Some of the most obvious functions of colour are:
Anonymous birth	Anonymous birth is a legal concept in certain countries. This allows women to give birth to their baby at the hospital Anonymityly, that is to say without giving their name. After giving birth, the mother leaves the hospital. The baby is put up for adoption after a certain time.
Anonymous work	Anonymous works are works, such as art or literature, made by someone who is Anonymity. Some authors or artists choose to keep their identity a secret; others cannot reveal their names for legal reasons. In 2007, The Washington Post published an article by an anonymous author describing the use of national security letters by the FBI. In this case, the author, who would have preferred to be named, could not reveal his or her identity because it was against the law. Some anonymous works are not created by people who choose to be anonymous, but their creators are unknown (not by choice). With some very old or Ancient history works, the creator's name may simply be lost over the course of history, or historians are not sure. In such cases the author is often referred to as Anonymus, the Latin form of "anonymous". In the United States it is legally d as "a work on the copies or phonorecords of which no human being is identified as author."
Anoxic event	An anoxic event (AE) is an event in which parts of the ocean have become low in oxygen below the surface levels, or when all the oxygen has gone. They may be called oceanic anoxic events or deep ocean anoxic events. Major anoxic events have happened, though not for millions of years. The geological record of organic-rich sediment (black shales) shows that they happened in the past. However, only "in rare, extreme cases, [did] euxinia lead to biotic crises. [The] hypothesis [is] best supported by evidence from the end-Permian mass extinction".<ref name=Meyer/> Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions. These mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphy dating. Typically, oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years, before a full recovery. There are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level. 'Dead zones' exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay, in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat, the Black Sea, in the northern Adriatic and off the coast of Louisiana.
Anthropomorphism	Anthropomorphism is the addition of human traits to something that is not a human. For example, the non-human might have human emotions, needs, and wants. It is common for people to use anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is often used in stories and art. The story of the "Three Little Pigs" has a wolf and three pigs who talk and act like humans. Disney's Mickey Mouse also talks and acts like a human. An anthropomorphized animal is called a "furry". The novel The Call of the Wild also uses anthropomorphism. The main character is a dog named Buck. Many other characters are dogs and wolves. In the story, the animals think and act more like humans than dogs.
Anti-social behaviour order	An ASBO, or an Antisocial behaviour order, is a UK legal term for an order that is sometimes served on people who often behave badly and have many complaints made against them because of their behaviour. The order is designed to stop them from being anti-social, which means causing distress or alarm (among other things) to other people that do not live in the same place as themselves, according to the Crime & Disorder Act. 1998. ASBO's were ended and replaced with "Injunctions" in 2015 Some types of anti-social behaviour are:
Antiphon (music)	In Christianity liturgy, an antiphon is the name of a short section, between the Clergy, and usually the crowd. These sections are either spoken (the priest asks something, and the crowd gives a predefined answer, also spoken), or they are sung. When they are sung, the often use simple melodies. Antiphons are very old: In the 4th century they were used in what is called Ambrosian chant today. In liturgy, antiphons are not used on their own: the priest or person of the clergy says or chants these, while performing a ritual. In many pieces of church music, the choir (who replaces the crowd) starts singing as a response to an antiphon. In more modern forms of church music (such as Gospel music, but also traditional African music), there's a tradition of Call and response (music). A lead singer calls something, and the choir responds.
Antivirus software	Antivirus software (or anti-virus software) aims to prevent to computer systems by unwanted computer malware. Viruses, worms or trojan horses can be used by criminals or mischievous people (called 'Hacker'). They can be used to steal information or damage system files. If no antivirus software is on a computer, hackers may be able to access the information in the computer.
AnyTo	iMyFone AnyTo is a location changing program that allows user change their iPhone, iPad, iPod and Android phone's GPS location to anywhere in the world. Besider, it can simulate GPS movement to make the iPhone, iPad and Android phone move along; it can set the moving speed and times for the route, and pause anytime; it can search for a specific coordinates as the destination. AnyTo is available for both Windows and macOS. It supports iOS 7.0 and above, Android 5.0 and above. It supports 3 modes which are teleport mode, two-spot mode and multi-spot mode.
Apache Subversion	Apache Subversion (also called subversion repository and SVN) is an internet software mainly used by software programmers. Subversion allows other developers to view the code easily. To download files in a directory of a subversion repository, one can "checkout" using a List of subversion clients.
Apex predator	Apex predators are predators with no natural predators of their own. They are at the top of their food chain. Apex predators have big effects on the animals and plants lower down the food chain. If they become extinct in an area, many changes happen. In recent times, it is often humans who have removed top predators. An example of apex predators affecting an ecosystem is in Yellowstone National Park. After the gray wolf was reintroduced, in 1995, researchers noticed big changes occurring in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Elk, the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior. This freed the riparian (river) zones from constant grazing. This allowed willows, aspens, and cottonwoods to grow, so creating a habitat for beaver, moose, and scores of other species. In addition to the effects on prey species, the gray wolf's presence also affected the park's grizzly bear, a vulnerable species. The bears, emerging from hibernation, chose to scavenger off wolf kills after fasting for months. They can also eat wolf kills in autumn to prepare for hibernation. As grizzly bears give birth during hibernation, a greater food supply may improve the mother’s nutrition and increase the number of cubs. Dozens of other species, including eagles, ravens, magpies, coyotes, and black bears, have been seen scavenging from wolf kills.
Aphasia	Aphasia is damage to the brain which affects speech. It is used for all forms of brain damage which negatively affects speech. The damage may cause muteness, in which case treatment depends on knowing exactly what caused the aphasia. The condition primary progressive aphasia is serious because it is progressive. It gets worse with time.
Apostatic selection	Apostatic selection is frequency-dependent natural selection by predators. It applies when prey are two or more forms (morphs) which look quite different. This is a kind of Polymorphism, where the predator learns to select the more common form. Then there is an advantage in looking different, and this advantage keeps the frequency above the mutation rate. The second form, or 'morph', becomes better known by predators as its number increases. So the population tends to have a kind of balance between the frequency of the two morphs. Apostatic selection is similar to the idea of prey switching. Apostatic selection is the term used when the different forms are genetics morphs. In comparison, 'prey switching' is used when describing the predator's choice between different species.
Appeal	In law, an appeal is the process in which legal cases are reviewed. An appeal is made to a higher court than the one that made the initial judgment (law). This is usually an appeals court. The person pursuing an appeal is called an appellant. When a lower court judgement is filed, the losing party (appellant) must file a notice of appeal. The appellant must give the appeals court legal reasons for reversing the decision of the lower court.<ref name=LawCom/> Usually the legal argument includes legal precedents that relate to this case.<ref name=LawCom/> The other party, called a respondent or appellee files a brief that counters the claims of the appellant. In turn, the appellant may counter the response of the appellee with a final brief.<ref name=LawCom/> Then, if the appeals court agrees to hear the case each party argues their case before the court. The appeals court may sustain the original court ruling. They may also reverse the decision sending it back to the lower court. No new evidence is introduced in an appeals court.<ref name=LawCom/>
Appellate court	An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that hears an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels. The trial court, which initially hears legal case and reviews evidence and [[Wikt:testimony|testimony]] to determine the facts of the case. There is at least one appellate court. The top level is a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the Judgement (law) of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules. The [[Wikt:authority|authority]] of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review. "Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'".
Applet	An applet is a computer program that can be run inside a web browser. Most of the time, applets are written in Java (programming language). They are used to display a scrolling menu on a website, for example, the applet is also used to show some applications. In Java, there is a Object-oriented programming called "Applet," which is extended when writing applets.
Application programming interface	An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, r systems, acting as a retrieve the necessary data the user is requesting from the system. Main types of web APIs:
Applied behavior analysis	Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a way to help organisms change their behavior, and to identify the environmental contingencies that result in this behavior change. ABA, the application of behavior analysis, is based on the scientific approach known as Radical Behaviorism, which views covert events as behavior that are to be subjected to the same conditions as overt behavior. ABA can be used as a treatment for animals, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities, and is based on the of behavior that were discovered using experiments.
Aquatic	Aquatic is a term often used in biology and ecology. Literally, it means watery, and refers to both fresh and salt-water. So aquatic plants or animals are those that live in water: ponds, rivers, oceans. Aquatic mammals include whales, dolphins, Pinniped, walrus, and also otters, beavers, and other river forms. Aquatic birds are even more numerous: ducks, herons, waders, kingfishers, penguins.
Aqueous solution	An aqueous solution is a solution where the solvent is water. In a chemical equation it is written by adding (aq) to the Chemical formula. A solution of ordinary table salt in water would be written as NaCl(aq). NaCl is the part that means table salt. The word aqueous means being solvation in water. Water is a solvent. It is found all over the place. Water is a solvent in chemistry.
Aquifer	An aquifer is an underground layer where the material contains water. That can be less solid material like sand, gravel, clay or silt, but it can be Rock (geology) as well, as long as the rock allows water to get in (that means that it is water-bearing).From such layers or groundwater can be usefully extracted using a well. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.
Arabesque	Arabesque is an artistic . It uses "surface decorations based on... interlacing , " or plain lines. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves... combined with spiralling stems". Arabesques are usually of a single design which can be 'tiled' or repeated as many times as desired. The term "arabesque" is used as a technical term by art historians for decoration in Islamic art from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the Renaissance onwards. Note that Islamic geometric patterns are a different style from arabesques.
Arable land	Arable land (from Latin arabilis, "able to be plowed") is land capable of being plowed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was looked at differently from land that could be used as pasture for raising animals but not for farmland.
Arbitration	Arbitration, a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), is a way of resolving disputes outside the courts. Litigation can be expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. With arbitration the parties to a dispute agree to have the decided by a . More often this is a panel of three arbitrators. Each party suggests one, then both arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator.<ref name=FL/> The decision is the result of a majority vote.<ref name=FL/>
Arboreal	Arboreal is an adjective in biology for an animal which lives in the trees. All forests have had animals living in them. Those animals have adaptations which enable them to live and move about in trees. The earliest one known is Suminia, a synapsid of the late Permian, about 260 million years ago.
Arc flash	Arc flash is an accidental electrical explosion usually caused by a short circuit. It usually happens at higher-voltages (around 300 volts and above). It can cause the electrical conductors to melt creating an explosion of molten or even vaporized metal. Temperatures can be as high as 20000 degrees Celsius. Arc flash is one of the reasons it is so important to turn the power off before working on any high-voltage equipment.
Arc welding	Arc welding is the most effective way of permanently joining Metal. It melts the two metals being joined and fuses them together, effectively turning them into one solid unit. Arc welding uses electricity to melt the metals and the welding filler by creating an electrical arc. An electrical arc is like a tiny lightning bolt that passes between two metals, generating intense heat that melts the two metals and the filler material, fusing them together. Commonly used for ship building in World War II, this method of welding has become common for creating steel structures.
Archetype	In psychology, an archetype is a model of a person, personality, or behavior. In the analysis of personality, the term archetype is often broadly used to refer to
Architecture	Architecture is designing the structures of buildings. It uses both art and engineering. Examples include houses, churches, hotels, office buildings, roads, viaducts, tunnels and bridges. Architecture is the profession of an architect. Usually, a person must at an institution of higher education (university) to become an architect. There were architects long before there was higher education. They learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect. Architecture can do small designs, such as for a garage, or large designs, such as for a whole city. The capital cities of Brasília, and Canberra were designed. Architecture often overlaps with structural engineering, and architects and engineers often work together.
Architecture of Singapore	The architecture of Singapore shows influences and styles from different places and periods. Singapore architecture may be divided into two periods: the more traditional pre-World War II colonial period, and the modern post-war and post-colonial period.
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (abbreviated ANWR) is in northeastern Alaska. It was Creating to protect and keep the area's Wildlife and wilderness. Some of these are polar bears, Brown bear, grey wolf, and Reindeer. Fish species include Dolly Varden, Arctic char, Lake trout and several kinds of salmon. There are at least 194 species of birds that visit or live here. The refuge totals 19,286,722 acres. In the ground under ANWR is one of the last major Petroleum in the United States. There are debates on whether or not to allow oil drilling. Those in favor have argued that removing the Petroleum will make the U.S. less dependent on foreign supplies of oil. In the 1990s, the U.S. imported over half of the oil it used. ANWR is also near the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. It contains large oil deposits that are already providing oil. But, the refuge land is a fragile natural environment. The area proposed for oil drilling is also the birth for the Porcupine caribou herds.
Arctic ecology	Arctic ecology is the science that studies the ecology of the arctic. The arctic is all land and water north of the Arctic Circle (66 33’). This area is very cold and has little rain. In the winter there is almost no sunlight. The growing season, when farmers can grow crops, is very short. The arctic biomes are taiga, boreal forest, and tundra. Many of the ecosystems in the arctic are fragile, and can be easily destroyed. These ecosystems are being hurt by global warming.
Arduino	Arduino is a small popular electronic machine that makes it very easy for people to make electronic things. It has two parts: a Printed circuit board and a Computer program that lets people tell the circuit board what to do. As of 2011, more than 300,000 Arduinos had been sold.
Area	Area is the amount of Space (physics) a two dimensional (flat) surface takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container. Area is the amount of surface covered by a close object or shape. Small areas can be measured in square centimetre and large areas in square kilometre. The area of a planar figure is often written as A. Areas of regular shapes such as square, rectangle, triangle and circle can be calculated through Scientific method. The area of an irregular shape can be approximated through grid or graph paper. One can use different formulas to find the area of different shapes. For example:<ref name=":0" />
Arecibo message	The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974. It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth. M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others.<ref name="phoneet" /> The message was in seven parts which show:<ref name=cassiday/>
Art	Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. It produces a product, an object. Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing the author's imaginative mind. The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that can be used. That kind of art is sometimes called a craft. Those who make art are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity. "The arts" is a much broader term. It includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, Performing arts, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre.
Art exhibition	An art exhibition is a place where works of art are shown to the public. The word exhibition comes from Latin language exhibere, which means to show. This can be in a museum or an exhibition hall. The exhibition can be temporary, or permanent (like a section of a museum). Some exhibitions show works of art of the same artist, others show works of art on a common .
Art history	Art history is the study of objects of art in their historical development and stylistic contents; that is genre, design, format, and style. The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture and other decorative objects. An art historian is a person who studies the history of art, and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well. The first person to become an art historian was Giorgio Vasari. He lived in Florence during the Renaissance, at a time when there were many famous artists alive. Vasari was an artist himself. He decided to write down all the stories that were told in Florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous. He included biography of several other artists from Northern Italy as well. When all the information was collected and the biographies written, he published them in 1568 in a book called Lives of the Artists. Because of this book, art students today have a lot of information about artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Titian and their works.
Artificial language	An artificial language is a language specially made for a purpose. These languages can be based on an existing natural language or can be artificial. Some types of artificial languages are:
Arts and crafts	Arts and crafts describes a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands. Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised since Prehistory times, others are more recent inventions. William Morris, John Ruskin and others promoted an "arts and crafts" movement in the late 19th century, which popularized the phrase. Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in schools may learn skills such as woodworking, wood carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of material. Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills.

It transmits digital satellite television and satellite radio to households in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore. Astro is owned by MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems, which is a subsidiary of Astro All Asia Networks plc.
Astro Nusantara	Astro Nusantara is a satellite television service in Indonesia. Astro Nusantara is operated by PT Direct Vision (found on 28 February 2006), a joint venture company between Astro All Asia Networks plc and PT First Media Tbk. subsidiary PT. Direct Vision. Currently, the service consists of 48 channels including 5 locally produced Indonesia exclusive channels were launched under the Astro brand.
Astrobiology	Astrobiology is the study of life in outer space. The field of astrobiology looks for conditions necessary for life, like liquid water, a good temperature, or the presence of oxygen. Some possible places to find life in the solar system are Europa (moon), Ganymede, moons of Jupiter (planet), or Titan (moon), and Enceladus, moons of Saturn (planet). These places may have liquid water. They may be too cold to support life on their surfaces, but if they have liquid water, the water must be warm enough to support life. Astrobiologists suggest that there may be a liquid water ocean under their surfaces.
Astrometry	Astrometry is a part of astronomy that has to do with measuring the motion of objects in space such as stars. Two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax. Proper motion is an object’s change in position over time when seen from the Earth. Just like anything else that moves, a Star proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved. The difference with stars is that, from Earth, they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year. When a star has a large proper motion, it usually means that it is nearby. Barnard’s Star, the star with the largest proper motion, only moves 1 degree across the sky (3600 arcseconds) in 348 years. Parallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places. When an object is seen from a new place, there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance. Parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight. Parallax can also be used to measure distances to the nearest few thousand stars. These distances are measured in parsecs which are equal to about 3.26 light years.
Astronomical Almanac	The Astronomical Almanac is a book published each year by the United States Naval Observatory and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office. It includes information on astronomy such as the setting and rising times of the sun, moon, planets and stars, as well as eclipses. It has been published since 1767. In 1981 the American and British publications were combined.
Astronomical clock	An astronomical clock is a clock with special mechanisms and dials to display astronomical information. It shows the relative positions of the sun, moon, zodiacal constellations, and sometimes major planets. Some examples are large public clocks, but others are instruments for use inside buildings. Astronomical watches are made by several manufacturers. They are also extremely accurate. The clocks made in the Middle Ages used the geocentrism method, showing the Earth at the centre. The Sun rotates round the Earth: this accords with daily experience and with the world view of pre-Copernicus Europe. The idea of an astronomical clock is ancient. Although not a clock in the traditional sense, the 2nd century BC Antikythera mechanism of ancient Greece was used to calculate the positions of the sun, moon, and stars at any given point by use of complex mechanical gears. European astronomical clocks are probably descended from the technology of the Antikythera mechanism. As Cicero later wrote in the 1st century BC, Archimedes and Posidonius's orrery achieved virtually the same thing.
Astronomy	Astronomy (from the Greek astron (ἄστρον) meaning "star" and nomos (nόμος) meaning "law") is the Science of celestial bodies such as stars, planets, comets, and galaxies. The imaginary patterns in the night sky are called constellations. The objects studied include stars, Galaxy, planets, natural satellites, asteroids, comets and nebulae. Phenomena outside the Earth's atmosphere are also studied. That includes supernova, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomy concerns the development, physics, chemistry, meteorology and movement of celestial bodies, as well as the structure and development of the Universe. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Ancient Greek people used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant crops. Astronomy is very similar to astrophysics. A related subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the Universe as a whole, and the way the universe changed over time. Astronomy is not the same as astrology, the belief that motion of the stars and the planets may affect human lives. Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, observational and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to explain the observations and predict what might happen. Working together, theories predict what should happen and observations show whether the predictions work. The main work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the universe. For thousands of years the most important issue was the motions of planets; now many other topics are studied.
AtariAge	</ref> Atari Age is named after the 1982–84 Atari Age magazine. AtariAge also features a searchable database of many things related to Atari video games, including manuals, packaging art, estimated rarity, screenshots, reviews and more, and also an Atari Age magazine archive. A community of homebrew (video games) developers for Atari and other classic video game systems is also hosted. Some homebrew games AtariAge published first have been included in official video game compilations, such as Activision Anthology.
Atlassian	Atlassian Corporation is an Australian software development company for the IT industry. It is best known for its JIRA and Confluence bug tracking system. The company is headquartered in Seattle, USA. In total, the company has nine offices in six countries and serves more than 100,000 customers.
Atom (feed)	The name Atom applies to a pair of related standards. The Atom Syndication Format is an XML language used for web feeds. The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP) is a simple HTTP-based system of rules for creating and updating web resources.
Atomic number	The atomic number (symbol: Z) of an atom is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of the atom. The atomic number of an atom identifies which chemical element it is. In a Neutral particle atom, the atomic number is equal to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.<ref name=daintith /> The elements of the periodic table are listed in order of increasing atomic number.<ref name=moore /> Atomic number is not the same as:
Atrium	An atrium is a large open space inside a building. The term goes back to Ancient Rome, where certain houses where built with a large empty space in the center.
Attack model	Attack models or attack types specify how much information a Cryptanalysis has access to when breaking or cracking an Encryption message, commonly known as codebreaking or cracking the code. Some common attack models are:
Attorney general	An attorney general is the main legal advisor for governments. In some areas, he or she might be also in charge of law enforcement and public prosecutions. In United Kingdom, attorneys general are called Law Officers of the Crown.
Audiolingual method	The Audiolingual Method is a method for teaching languages. Linguists at the University of Michigan invented this [[wiktionary:Method|method]] in the late 1950s. In the Audiolingual method, students first hear a language. Later, they speech the language, and after that, they read and write in it. This way of language teaching is similar to the Direct Method. Like the Direct Method, the Audiolingual Method does not use the students’ native language. For example, if you are in an English language class in Turkey, the teacher only speaks English, and no Turkish language. However, unlike the Direct Method, the Audiolingual Method does not teach vocabulary. Rather, the teacher drills grammar. In the Audiolingual method, grammar is most important for the student. In other words, the student must repeat grammar patterns after the teacher. The students do not learn lots of vocabulary. This method also uses psychology. The students get a reward for speaking correctly. They get punishment if they speak incorrectly; because it is based on habit formation, which is establishesd by stimulus, response and Operant conditioning. It gives priority to speaking the target language, and using the native language is not allowed.
Audiophile	An audiophile is a person who cares about how good music sounds on a stereo or other high fidelity sound system. An audiophile is interested in how to improve the sound quality of sound recordings, such as vinyl records and Compact Discs, as well as the equipment used to listen to recordings such as CD players, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Audiophiles are always looking for ways to improve their sound system. There are discussion forums, magazines and clubs for audiophiles to share their ideas. Some audiophiles believe that differences should be able to be measured in a science way. This type of audiophile is called an "objectivist". Other audiophiles believe that "what sounds better" or "more musical" may not be measurable. They rely mostly on their own ears and preferences. This type of audiophile is called a "subjectivist". Audiophile is also used as an adjective in descriptions of audio equipment and recorded music, where it is intended to imply high quality.
Australian Aboriginal astronomy	Indigenous Australians were some of the first people in the world to develop ideas with astronomy. It is possible that their interpretation of astronomy is the oldest still alive today.<ref name="haynes"/> Studying astronomical subjects – such as the Sun, Moon, stars and planets – and the way they appeared to move was used as a way to find and explain the relationship between people, nature and the sky.<ref name="angelo"/> The ideas that came from this contributed to their basic perception of the universe (their cosmology), and still form an important part of traditional culture and knowledge.<ref name="bhathal"/> Many Australian Aboriginal mythology, Aboriginal art, Australian Aboriginal music and Ceremony originate from interpretations of astronomical Phenomenon and Astronomical object in the sky. Many Aboriginal groups give spiritual or mythological meanings to these things. Some groups used their knowledge of the movement of objects across the sky to develop practical tools like calendars. Old Australian Aboriginal culture is an oral tradition, so knowledge of astronomy has been passed down through stories, song and dance.<ref name="angelo"/> A lot of knowledge is kept secret, only passed to those who have been Initiation. As in all aspects of Aboriginal society, some things are only known to men, other things are only known to women.<ref name="bhathal"/> The earliest written account of Aboriginal astronomy was published in 1857. It was written by Edward Stanbridge, an Englishman who became friends with the Boorong people of Victoria (Australia).<ref name="norris"/> Astronomy is a huge part of Aboriginal people's Sociology, Culture and Religion knowledge. It has little relation to the scientific theory of Western thinking. There are many different Aboriginal groups in Australia, and each interpret the sky in different ways. The interpretations all developed along the same lines and share the same basic themes, but can be very different in meaning. Most objects and phenomena are interpreted as figures or events in the Dreamtime. Unlike in other ancient cultures, these legends and beliefs are still part of modern life for Australian Aborigines.<ref name="bhathal"/>
Autism	Autism is the name of a disorder affecting brain development. It is one of a group of disorders called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and childhood autism are kinds of autism spectrum disorders. ASD is a condition that affects the way a Human relates to their environment. The word spectrum is used because not all people with autism have the same Trait and difficulties. Some people find interacting more difficult than others. Autism may be very apparent in someone or they may show no outward signs of it. The main areas of difficulty are in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests. In most cases of autism, motor communication is affected. All these signs develop in the child's first two to three years of age. People who have autism find it difficult to act in a way that other people think is "normal". They may find it difficult to talk to other people and to look at other people in the eyes. Some people with autism do not like being Sensory overload. A person who has autism can seem to be turned inwards. They may talk only to themselves, rock themselves backwards and forwards, and laugh at their own thoughts. They might not like any type of change and may find it very difficult to learn a new behavior like going to school. Autism is caused by the way that the brain develops, both before and after a baby is born. About one in every 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder. It has no known cure, and many autistic people do not want a cure. They want it to be accepted as a difference. This is known as neurodiversity.
Autogenic training	Autogenic training is a technique developed by the Germany psychiatrist Johannes Schultz and first published in 1932. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (e.g. lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll, etc.). Schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. However, unlike some forms of yoga and meditation, autogenic training is devoid of any mysticism. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system.
Automatic behaviour	Automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur (or that continue to occur), without Consciousness thought. Usually, they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system, or visceral nervous system. Automatic behaviour is like a reflex.
Autopackage	Autopackage is a free computer programme aimed at making it simple to create other programs that can be installed on all Linux distributions.Right now, the only operating system to include Autopackage is Super Ubuntu
Autotransformer	An Autotransformer (sometimes called autostep down transformer) is a transformer which has only one Electromagnetic coil. The "[[wiktionary:auto-|auto]]" (Greek language for "self") prefix refers to the single Electromagnetic coil acting on itself and not to any kind of Automation. The winding acts as both primary winding and secondary winding in a normal transformer. Since part of the winding does "double duty", autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers. The disadvantage of an autotransformer include not providing Galvanic isolation between the Transformer and the Transformer. There is also a higher possibility of short circuits due to low Electrical impedance.<ref name=Ghosh101/>
Autotroph	An autotroph (from Ancient Greek autos = self and trophe = nutrition) is an organism that makes organic compounds from simple molecules.
Availability factor	Availability factor in a power plant is the amount of time that it is able to produce electricity over a certain period, divided by the amount of the time in the period. The availability factor depends on the type of power plant, the source of energy used and how the plant is operated. Newer types of power plants usually have higher availability factors than old power plants.
Avalanche effect	The avalanche effect (“landslide effect”) is a property of block ciphers and cryptographic hash function algorithms. It is often desired in cryptography. The effect says that a lot of the output must change, even when the input changes only a little. In good block ciphers this means: A small change in the key (cryptography) or the plaintext should cause a strong change in the ciphertext. This means that small changes can spread fast, when the algorithm uses iterations. Thus, every bit of the output depends on every bit of the input. The term avalanche effect was first used by Horst Feistel (Feistel 1973). Later, the concept was identified by Confusion and diffusion. If a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not satisfy the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization. Thus, a cryptanalysis can make Forecasting about the input, if given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break (crack) the algorithm. It is one of the primary design objectives when people create a strong cipher or cryptographic hash function. They try to build a good avalanche effect in it. Mathematics this uses the butterfly effect. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks.
Avant-garde	Avant-garde (pronounced ) in French language means "front guard", "advance guard", or "vanguard". The term is commonly used in French, English, and German for people or works that are experimental or Innovation, particularly in the areas of art, culture, and politics. Avant-garde represents a going against what is accepted as the norm, especially in culture.
Aviation	Aviation refers to flying using an aircraft, like an aeroplane. It also includes the activities and industries related to flight, such as air traffic control. The biggest of the many uses of aviation are in air travel and military lund.
Aviation Without Borders	Aviation Without Borders is a voluntary association created to put the flying skills of its members to the service of humanitarian assistance. It provides air transport for various Non-governmental organization in direct contact with affected people. The aircraft used generally belong to AWB and additional equipment can be rented for well defined missions.
Axis of rotation	The Axis of rotation is an imaginary line passing through the centre of mass of any celestial body around which the celestial body rotates. In case of Earth, the axis of rotation of Earth passes through the north pole, the centre of mass of Earth and the South Pole. The Earth makes one complete rotation around this imaginary axis every 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds.The line passes through the north and south poles of a planet.
BIOS	BIOS, computing, stands for Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS is a computer program embedded on a chip on a computer's motherboard that recognizes and controls various devices that make up the computer. The purpose of the BIOS is to make sure all the things plugged into the computer can work properly. It brings life to the computer, and the term is a pun on the Greek Language word , bios meaning "life". "Booting", sometimes called "Booting up" is the process that the computer completes to get it ready to use when it is first turned on. When the computer turns on, the BIOS starts up and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST). During the POST, the BIOS will check various devices in the computer like the CPU, RAM, the video card and others to make sure they are present and functioning. Once the POST has completed successfully, the BIOS looks for an operating system to load, which is usually located on the computer's hard drive. When it finds one, it starts to load it. At this point, the operating system takes over control of the system.
BOINC	BOINC, or The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, is an organization that lets ordinary people use their computers to do scientific work. SETI, or Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is the most popular of the BOINC programs. SETI searches for radio signals from outer space that might be a sign of alien life and worlds. BOINC involves other scientific work. For example, it allows individuals to use their computer to find the structures of proteins, a cure for the disease malaria or the very structure of our galaxy, the Milky Way.
Background music	Background music is music that appears in the background of videos. The music is mostly the same mood as the video. Background music is mostly used to create a mood in the video it is used in.
Backmasking	Backmasking (also known wrongly as backward masking) is a sound recording technique. In backmasking, a sound or message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was made popular by The Beatles. Some people think that backmasking causes subliminal persuasion.
Bailout	A bailout is when financial help is given to a corporation or country which is close to failure or bankruptcy.
Bandwidth (signal processing)	Bandwidth is used to measure electronics and other types of communication. This includes radio, electronics, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, Bandwidth is the difference between the electronic signal having highest-frequency and the signal having the lowest-frequency. In computer networks, bandwidth is often used as a term for the data transfer bit rate. More easily, the amount of data that is carried or passed from one point to another in a network, in a given time period (usually a second).
Bangladeshi passport	After the so-called Pakistan Civil War (1971), Act Number 9 of 1973 (called The Bangladesh Passport Order, 1973) which was signed into effect by the President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on 8 February 1973, this lead to the creation and issuing of the first passport of a newly separatist Bangladesh.<ref name="Bangladesh Passport Order" /> These passport booklets were traditional, handwritten or manual, passports and were compliant with the relevant international laws and regulations in force at the time. Subsequently, additional laws were enacted in Bangladesh in the years that followed to improve the passport application process; enforce the ineligibility to hold multiple valid Bangladeshi passports; citizenship requirement for a passport; etc. Since 1972 a special passport, also known as the India-Bangladesh Special Passport, used to be issued to Bangladeshi citizens and Indian nationals resident in West Bengal State and the North-east India only.
Banyan	A banyan (or 'banian') is a kind of fig. It usually starts life by growing on another plant as an epiphyte. Its seeds Germination in the cracks and crevices on a host (biology) tree, or on other structures like buildings and bridges. "Banyan" usually means the Indian banyan or Ficus benghalensis. It is the List of national trees of the Republic of India. and of Bangladesh respectively. However, the term actually includes all figs which share their epiphytic life cycle. They are put in the subgenus Urostigma. The seeds of banyans are dispersed by frugivore birds. The seeds germinate and send down roots towards the ground. These roots may envelop (cover) part of the host tree or building structure, from which they get the casual name of strangler fig. A number of tropical forest species grow by strangling. There are other examples in the genus Ficus that competes for light. Any Ficus species showing this habit may be termed a strangler fig. The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy green and ellipse in shape. Like most of the fig-trees, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales fall. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge. Older banyan trees have Aerial roots that grow into thick woody trunks which, with age, can become indistinguishable from the main trunk. Old trees can spread out laterally using these prop roots to cover a wide area. Like other Fig species (including the common edible fig Ficus carica), banyans have unique fruit structures and are dependent on fig wasps for reproduction.
Barycenter	The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Greek language βαρύκεντρον) is the point between two objects where they balance each other. For example, it is the center of mass where two or more planets orbit each other. When a natural satellite orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies outside the center of the larger body. For example, the moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth. It actually orbits a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon. This is about 1,710 km below the surface of the Earth. This is the point where the mass of the moon and the mass of the Earth balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. The solar system of course also has a barycenter—depending on the current locations of the planets the barycenter of the solar system is below the surface of the sun or more than twice the sun’s diameter outside of the sun's surface. Also the barycenter exists in the world of geometry. For example, the circle has a barycenter.
Base (chemistry)	A base is a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion (H+) from another substance. A chemical can accept a proton if it has a negative charge, or if the molecule has an electronegative atom like oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine that is rich in electrons. Like Acid, some bases are strong and others are weak. The weak bases are less likely to accept protons, while the strong bases quickly take protons in solution or from other molecules.An acid is a base's "chemical opposite". An acid is a substance that will donate a hydrogen atom to the base. Bases have a pH greater than 7.0. Weak bases generally have a pH value of 79 while strong bases have a pH value of 9–14.
Base (geometry)	In Plane (mathematics) geometry, the base is the side on which a polygon rests on, and which is used as a referenced side for other measurements. The base of a triangle or quadrilateral is often written as b. It is used in the calculation of the area of a triangle and parallelogram. Many geometry shapes of more than two dimensions are constructed by using regular two-dimensional shapes. For example, a tetrahedron is constructed with four triangles, and a cube with six squares. In that context, the shape that is used for construction is called base. The triangle is the base of the tetrahedron, and the square is the base of the cube. However, there are also geometric figures that are constructed using different shapes. A pyramid, for example. uses one rectangle and four triangles. In that context, the rectangle is said to be the base of the shape. A cylinder uses a circle or an ellipse as a base.
Basic needs	There have been several classifications of the needs of a person. While these classifications vary, they commonly place the basic needs at the lowest level. Basic needs are those that must be satisfied, to guarantee survival. According to Abraham Maslow these include:
Basso continuo	Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment (music) used in the Baroque music. It means "continuous bass". Basso continuo, sometimes just called "continuo", was played by an instrument providing chordal accompaniment such as a keyboard instrument or plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an Organ (music), such as a small portative instrument. It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player.<ref name="ammer"/> The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and doubled on the other bass instrument. The composer would indicate what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.
Batik	Batik is an Indonesian method of dyeing cloth and making it resistant using wax. Such fabrics originally come from the island of Java island. Nowadays, batik also can be found worldwide, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Battery (crime)	Battery is the intentional and or contact with another person. The exact definition varies by jurisdiction. In criminal law the elements of battery are physical contact that causes harm or offensive contact without that person's consent. Battery is often confused with assault which is threatening battery. Battery is when the threat (assault) is carried out and the person is harmed in some way. Criminal battery and Battery (tort) may be the same or differ slightly depending on jurisdiction. In many cases the act of battery can result in both criminal and civil [[Wikt:liability|liability]].<ref name=NOLO/>
Battery charger	A battery charger is a that makes a used battery able to be used again. It works by forcing electric current into it from the opposite Electric charge of the battery. However, only Rechargeable battery can be recharged with a battery charger. Battery chargers can be found in many forms, such as for mobile phone batteries, an electric vehicle charger, and a laptop battery charger (adapter).
Bauhaus	The Bauhaus was a design school that operated from 1919 to 1933 in Germany. It is widely regarded as the most influential art school of the 20th century. It promoted modernism. It is most well known for teaching painting, photography, advertising, weaving, architecture and the design of furniture and household products. The work that it produced and its teaching methods had a world-wide influence on art, design, photography, architecture and art education. It was formally called the "Staatliches Bauhaus" from 1919 to 1932 because it was state funded in that period. From 1919 to 1925 it was in Weimar, in the state of Thuringia and from 1926 to 1932 it was in Dessau, in the state of Sachsen-Anhalt. It operated as privately funded school in Berlin from the end of 1932 until April 1933. Its staff included some of the most famous artists and architects of the 20th century, including: Walter Gropius, who founded the school, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, Paul Klee, László Moholy-Nagy, Marcel Breuer, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, Oskar Schlemmer and Hannes Meyer. Its former buildings in Weimar and Dessau were jointly made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.<ref name="wh" />
Beauty	Beauty is a property of certain things. Something is beautiful if it is nice to look at it, hear it, feel it, taste it, smell it or think about it. It is also the name of a feeling that is hard to describe. The nature of this feeling varies from person to person and culture to culture. It is not known if only humans can feel it. There are many ideas about what beauty is. Some people say that beauty is:
Behaviorism	Behaviourism is an approach to study behaviour based only on what can be directly seen. Behaviorists focus on relationships between stimulus (psychology) and . Unseen qualities such as states of mind (any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state e.g. as a result of fear or anxiety) were not used in this type of study even though we know that the mind plays a part in all advanced animals' behaviors. Behaviourism states that behaviour can be studied without knowing what the physiology of an event is, and without using theory such as that of the mind. By definition, all behaviour can be observed. Behaviorism also relied on another idea, that all human behaviour was learned. Behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or operant conditioning. This is learning as a result of influences from past experiences. However, behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours, instinct, or inherited to behave. They did not believe, or ignored, the idea of heredity(passing of traits to offspring from parents), that something can come from a person's genes. This was the idea of the blank slate, that babies are born with a clean, empty mind. Humans, when born, are thought not to have mental experience or knowledge, and that everything is learned after they grow. The blank slate premise is opposed by modern evolutionary psychology. Major contributors, scientists to the field of behaviorism include C. Lloyd Morgan, Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner. Pavlov researched classical conditioning through the use of dogs and their natural ability to salivate, produce water in their mouths. Thorndike and Watson rejected looking at one's own conscious thoughts and feelings ("Introspection"). They wanted to restrict psychology to experiment. Skinner's research leant mainly on behaviour shaping using positive reinforcement (rewards rather than punishments). Today, ideas from behaviourism are used in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help people deal with anxiety and phobias, as well as with certain forms of addiction. As a scientific theory, behaviourism has largely been replaced by cognitive psychology.
Behaviour	Behaviour (or behavior) is what an animal does or how it acts. Behaviours may be conscious or unconscious. They may be Heredity or Learning. The term is also used for systems and for machines which interact with their environment. The term is not well-defined. In experiments, behaviour is the observed reaction which occurs when an organism is given a stimulus. Some organisms are more complicated than others and may be more of their surroundings. If their behaviour is consciousness it means that they know what they are doing. If they are not aware of what they are doing this is unconscious behaviour. Humans will pull their hand back without if they accidentally touch something heat. This is done because we (and other animals) inherit nervous system reflexes which cause us to pull away from the thing that is causing the pain. Behaviour is linked to the nervous system as well as the endocrine system. The nervous system reacts, and notices what happens. The hormone system is much slower. It makes some kinds of behaviour more, or less, likely. A simple example is the change from being a child to an adult. This involves a whole range of hormones which affect growth and behaviour. Behaviour is also linked to learning. Organisms which are more complicated can learn better than those that are simpler. However, even the simplest animals show habituation, which is a primitive kind of learning. For organisms, learning means that they change their behaviour because they remember having been in that situation before and know how to react. People often use the word "behaviour" to mean the way people interact with (behave towards) one another. Children are taught what is good behaviour and what is bad behaviour. Good behaviour is about being and thoughtful to other people. It is the kind of behaviour that people in a society expect from others.
Beta particle	Beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted by some radioactive Atomic nucleus such as potassium-40 or carbon-14 (which becomes nitrogen-14). The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation sometimes called beta rays. Henri Becquerel and Ernest Rutherford discovered beta rays in the 1890s. Beta particles are made by beta decay. When scientists write it in an equation, they are use the Greek alphabet beta (β).There are two forms of beta decay, β- and β+, which make the electron and the positron. β- is a single electron that has a negative charge of -1. Both beta decays also turn a neutron into a proton.
Bias	Bias means that a person prefers an idea and possibly does not give equal chance to a different idea. Bias can be influenced by a number of factors, such as popularity (for example, a newspaper might be biased towards a particular political party due to their employees sharing the same political beliefs as that party). Bias in an article or editorial would show one point of view, using selected facts and quotes to support that point of view. Facts or opinions that do not support the point of view in a biased article would be excluded. For example, an article biased toward riding a motorcycle would show facts about the good gas mileage, fun, and agility. An article biased against motorcycle riding would show facts about risk of injury and noise, and ignore positive facts about motorcycles. An article biased against guns would show only facts and information that support the author's position. They would list suicides, accidental shootings and other facts showing guns in a negative way. An article biased for guns should show only information that supports the author's position. The positively biased article would discuss 'lives saved' by guns, numbers of crimes prevented by civilian gun use, and other facts and data that put gun ownership and guns in a good light. Bias in writing can also be shown by using bad or slang words to refer to groups of people or things. "Broads" rather than "women"; "murdercycles" rather than "motorcycles". Words or phrasing that make wide assumptions about races or groups of people also indicates bias. "All Chinese people are good at math". Bias also means mistakes in measurements. For example, a person may measure the height of another person wearing shoes. The shoes make the height more than the same person without shoes. If the extra height of the shoes (extra bias) was not explained, someone might think that the person had been measured without shoes on. Data with extra parts not explained is called biased data.
Bibliography	Bibliography (Ancient Greek βίβλος = book γραφή = write) is the arrangement of printed books and articles according to author or subject, and the publication of lists of titles. Bibliographies are of many different kinds and may be annotated with information about their contents. Bibliographies may be organized in various ways, such as by authors, subjects or date of publication. Bibliographies without annotations are sometimes given the modest title of checklists. Another meaning of Bibliography is the academic study of books as physical and cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as bibliology. This kind of bibliography is not concerned with the written content of books, but rather the "bookness" of books-–how they were designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted and collected.
Biggles	Biggles is a series of young adult adventure books. It was written by W. E. Johns. The series is named after the nickname of the main character, James Bigglesworth, who is a pilot and adventurer. There are around 100 Biggles books in total. The first Biggles book, The Camels are Coming, was published in 1932 and is a collection of short Biggles stories.
Bill (proposed law)	A bill is a proposed new law introduced within a legislature that has not been adopted. Once a bill has become law, it is thereafter an Statute; but in popular usage the two terms are often treated as if they meant the same.
Binary solution	A binary solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more than two substances whose composition can change within a certain limits. The boiling point of binary solution depends upon the solution composition and there can be three cases:
Bioaccumulation	Bioaccumulation is a process in which toxic substances (such as pesticides) accumulate in living organisms. This poses a threat to health, life, and the environment. Similar terms are bioconcentration, biological concentration, or biological magnification.
Biocenosis	Biocenosis is the idea that different species coexist in an enclosed habitat (usually called biotope). Biocenosis and biotope make up the ecosystem. Karl Möbius first used the term in 1877.
Biological control	Biological control, or biological pest control, is the reduction of Pest (biology) populations by using natural enemies. It is important because crop pests become Resistance to chemical pesticides. Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens. Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. Parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host. Most have a very narrow host range. Many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids. Pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific.
Biomass	Biomass is a basic term in ecology, and in the energy production industry.Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal dung and kitchen waste can be converted into gaseous fuel called biogas. The organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in biogas digesters to emit biogas which is essentially a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. In ecology, biomass means the accumulation of living matter. It is the total living material in a given area or a biological community or group. Biomass is measured by weight, or by dry weight, per given area (per square metre or square kilometer).In the energy industry, it refers to biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production. Biomass includes plant matter grown for use as biofuel, and also includes plant or animal matter used for production of fibres, chemicals or heat. Biomass may also include biodegradable wastes which can be burnt as fuel. It excludes Organic matter which has been Metamorphism into substances such as coal or petroleum. It is usually measured by dry weight.
Biophysical chemistry	Biophysical chemistry is the study of biological systems. It looks for explanations of the various in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the Supramolecular chemistry structure of these systems. Biophysical chemists use various tools used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These tools include spectroscopic methods like NMR spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. For example, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 was based on x-ray diffraction studies of ribosomes. Biophysical chemists study protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the Substrate (biochemistry) molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. Similarly, biophysical chemists study the structure and function of the biomembranes using model supramolecular structures. These include liposomes or phospholipid Vesicle (biology) of different compositions and sizes. The oldest well-known institute for biophysical chemistry is Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. The Biophysics Department of King's College London is where the X-ray crystallography studies of DNA was done in the early 1950s.
Biosphere	The biosphere includes everything living on Earth it is also known as ecosphere. Currently the biosphere has a biomass (or amount of living things) at around 1900 gigatonnes of carbon. It is not certain exactly how thick the biosphere is, though scientists predict that it is around 12,500 meters. The biosphere extends to the upper areas of Atmosphere of Earth, including birds and insects. In a general sense, biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems containing ecosystems. This includes artificial biospheres such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3, and potentially ones on other planets or moons.
Biosphere reserve	A biosphere reserve is an ecosystem with plants and animals of unusual science and nature interest. It is a label given by UNESCO to help protect the sites.<ref name=UNESCO/> The plan is to promote management, research and education in ecosystem conservation. This includes the 'sustainable use of natural resources'. If, for example, fish or trees are taken for human use, this is done in ways which least damage the ecosystem. A biosphere reserve consists of three zones:
Bioturbation	Bioturbation is the reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants. It disturbs and changes sediment. Any animal living in the soil or on the bottom under water may disturb the sediment by moving it around. Burrowing, eating and defecation of sediment grains, building galleries (etc.) all disturb the sediment. Common bioturbators include annelids ("ringed worms") such as oligochaeta, bivalves like mussels, clams, gastropods, holothurians. Fossil sites with bioturbation do not leave traces of soft-bodied animals. In contrast, fossil sites with undisturbed sediment have given rise to important lagerstätten with many impressions of small soft-bodied invertebrates.
BitTorrent	BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer computer program, first developed in mid-2001 by Bram Cohen and BitTorrent, Inc., to use for uploading and downloading files under the BitTorrent protocol. In the protocol, a "Tracker" hosts information about any active computers which are trying to share data. Trackers are used to find other active computers, but do not store or share file data. Using the .torrent files, BitTorrent users can "Leech" (download) the files. Once a "Leecher" gets 100% of the file(s), they become a "Seeder" and helps "Seed" (upload) the files to other Leechers. BitTorrent was the first client (computing) written for the protocol. Before version 6.0, BitTorrent was written in Python (programming language), and was free software. The source code for versions up to and including 3.4.2 were distributed under the MIT license and versions 4.x and 5.x were released under the BitTorrent Open Source License, a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License. Since version 6.0, BitTorrent is a rebranded version of µTorrent. As a result, its source is closed. The BitTorrent protocol now has many clients, for example :
Black and white	Black-and-white (B/W or B&W) images combine black and white in a continuous spectrum, producing a range of grayscale. In the 1910s through 1950s, all to some movies were made only in black and white. The earliest television broadcasts were transmitted in black-and-white, and received and displayed by black-and-white only television sets. Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's Color television#All-mechanical color on July 3, 1928
Black bloc	Black bloc is a protest strategy where people wear black clothes and cover up their faces. This helps them to not be recognized and to avoid pepper spray in their eyes.
Black start	Black start is the process to start up in a power station from zero, without the help of power from the electrical grid connected to the station. Usually, a power station uses its own set of electrical generator to start the plant. This is a diesel generator called the Black start diesel generator (BSDG). This powers up all electrical panels which control the station.
Blank slate	For the book see The Blank Slate Blank slate, or tabula rasa (which means the same thing) was a philosophy idea of John Locke. It had, like much of philosophy, a history which went as far back as Aristotle, but it was Locke who made it known to our modern world:
Bletchley Park	Bletchley Park is an estate in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It was the site of the United Kingdom's main codebreaking team during World War II. Now, Bletchley Park is home to the National Codes Centre and The National Museum of Computing. The Government Communications Headquarters and Station X, a secret radio interception station, was also at Bletchley Park. The information gained by workers at Bletchley Park was very important for the Allies of World War II war effort. In 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish military showed French and British intelligence agents their cryptanalysis of the Enigma (machine). They promised each delegation a Polish-built Enigma. Having an actual Enigma machine, and knowing how to use it, was a much-needed start for the British work at Bletchley Park. Dilly Knox and Alan Turing were later joined by many other codebreakers and engineering staff. The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park codenamed Ultra, gave crucial help to the Allied war effort. It was vital during the Battle of the Atlantic, when the German U-boat submarine fleet sank merchant shipping in an attempt to starve Britain of supplies. Winston Churchill was later to say:
Blindfold	A blindfold is a piece of cloth tied over a person's eyes. Sometimes a blindfold is made of material other than cloth. Blindfolds make it impossible to see. They are used for many different reasons:
Block (Internet)	A block is action taken to stop certain people having access to information. If a website activates a block based on the internet protocol address (IP address) of a user, that block can effect other users that share the address. Some blocked users try to get around the block by making a different account or using a proxy server.
Block cipher	In cryptography, a block cipher is a Symmetric-key algorithm cipher which operates on a groups of bits of fixed length, called blocks, using an exact transformation. During encryption, a block cipher algorithm might take (for example) a 128-bit block of plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input — the secret key (cryptography). Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and output the original 128-bit block of plaintext. One of the early block cipher designs was the Data Encryption Standard (DES), developed at IBM and published as a standard in 1977. A successor to DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); also using block cipher, was adopted in 2001.
Blog	A blog, also known as weblog, is a type of website that is like a diary or journal. Blog organizes content in the form of categories and posts. Posts on a blog are presented in reverse chronological order. That means your latest post goes to the top of the page. That way, when you make a new post, it will come first and the first post will go below it. Anyone can create a blog and then write on that blog. Bloggers (a word for people who write on blogs) often write about their opinions and thoughts. A blog containing video material is called a video blog or video log, usually shortened to vlog. When a person writes on a blog, what they write is in the form of a post, which is a single piece of writing on the blog. Posts often include links to other websites. Blogs can have one or more writers. If they have more than one writer, they are often called community blogs, team blogs, or group blogs because the thoughts are made by more than one person.
Blogcritics	Blogcritics is a blog network and online magazine of news and opinion. The site—a self-proclaimed "sinister cabal of superior writers"—was founded in 2002 by Eric Olsen and Phillip Winn. Blogcritics features hundreds of original articles every week, and keeps an archive of all their published content.
Bloomberg L.P.	Bloomberg L.P. is a privately held Finance, software, data, and News media company. It is headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by Michael Bloomberg in 1981 along with a 12% ownership investment by Merrill Lynch. The company has become very big and made Michael Bloomberg wealth, but many employees, especially women, felt that it was a Oppression company to work for.
Blowfish (cipher)	In cryptography, Blowfish is a key (cryptography)ed, Symmetric-key algorithm block cipher, made in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and since 1993 has been included(put together) in a large number of encryption products. Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no Cryptanalysis attack model of it has been found. However, the Advanced Encryption Standard block cipher algorithm now has more attention. Schneier made Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, to be used as a replacement for the old Data Encryption Standard algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other algorithms were proprietary, or were secrets. Schneier has said that, "Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone." Main features of the design include key-dependent Substitution boxes and a very complex key schedule. Blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people, except when changing key (cryptography). Each new key needs to be pre-processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This stops its use in certain applications (such as in the smallest embedded systems like the early smartcards), but it is not a problem in other applications. In one of the applications, it is actually good: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. See key strengthening. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size (cryptography) and a variable Key size from 0 up to 448 bits<ref></ref>It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent Substitution box. It is similar in structure to CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes. In 1996, Serge Vaudenay found a known-plaintext attack needing 28r + 1 known plaintexts to break, where r is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of weak keys that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 24r + 1 Known-plaintext attack. This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish; it assumes knowledge of the key-dependent S-boxes. Vincent Rijmen, in his Doctor of Philosophy papers, introduced a second-order Differential cryptanalysis that can break four rounds and no more. Still there is no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a brute-force search.A sign extension bug in one of the published C (programming language) has been found in 1996.<ref name="Bruce-Schneier-site-mailing-list"></ref> There is no good cryptanalysis on the full-round version of Blowfish known publicly till 2008. However, in 2007, Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use, he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead <ref name="schneier-interview-dec-2007"></ref>
Body armour	Modern body armour (personal armour/armor or body armor) is protective clothing. It is designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing, bludgeoning, and penetrating attacks. It was first used to protect soldiers, today it is used to protect Police, private security guards and bodyguards. There are two different types of armour. There is regular non-plated personal armor used by most police, security guards and bodyguards. There is also hard-plate reinforced personal armor, which is used by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams. Armour is certainly very ancient, but it was little used in infantry warfare for quite a long time, with the exception of helmets. From about the 18th century to the Vietnam War, men fought relatively unprotected. The weight and cost of effective armour meant it was no longer practical to have infantrymen armoured. The invention of carbon fibre, modern hard ceramics and various plastic compounds are suitable for light armour which is effective in many circumstances. Kevlar, Technora and Nomex are Aramids, which are long-chain aromatic polyamides. They are used to make bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a main component, as do their replacements. Most of these items have padding on the inside to act as shock-absorbers, and to increase comfort during while being worn. So, with the lighter weight and increased stopping-power of personal armour, the modern soldier is once again protected against most of the weapons of the day.
Body positivity	Body positivity is a social movement that believes that people should have a positive body image. The movement says that people should accept their body, no matter what it looks like. Society has always had certain expectations, what a body is supposed to look like. Fashion design in particular have expectations of what a human body is supposed to look like. Most people look different, and according to body positivity they should not feel bad because they do.<gallery>File:LA2-vx06-konsthallen-skulptur.jpg|The sculpture The women of bronze outside of the art museum, Växjö Municipality.

Bollywood Hungama	Bollywood Hungama (previously known as IndiaFM or IndiaFM.com) is a Bollywood entertainment website, owned by Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, which acquired the website in 2000. The website provides news related to the Indian film industry, particularly Bollywood, film reviews and box office reports. Launched on 15 June 1998, the website was originally named "IndiaFM.com". It changed its name to "Bollywood Hungama" in 2008. Bollywood Hungama release their images under the [[Wikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC-BY-3.0 license]].
Bolometric magnitude	Bolometric magnitude is the total magnitude of all electromagnetic radiation of a star or other object. It is an extension of luminosity to include all kinds of radiation.
Bond (finance)	A bond is a contract between two companies. Company or governments issue bonds because they need to borrow large amounts of money. They issue bonds and investment buy them (thereby giving money to the people who issued the bond). Bonds have a maturity date. This means that at some point, the bond issuer has to pay back the money to the investors. They also have to pay the investors a little bit more than they paid for the bond. Bonds are used to keep the company running smooth when needed, and can be used as protection if their stock drops drastically. Bonds are usually traded through brokers and are part of a financial instrument group called Fixed Income.Banks and finance offer loans on different terms against the security of assets. Simply put, a bond is a receipt given by a government or organization as an agreement to borrow money from another organization which will be returned at a later date with certain amount of interest or increment.
Bond market	The bond market (also known as the debt, credit, or fixed income market) is a Finance market where people buy and sell debt Security, usually in the form of Bond (finance). In 2006 the size of the international bond market was about $45 trillion. The size of the outstanding U.S. bond market debt was $25.2 trillion.
Book frontispiece	A frontispiece is a picture. It is in a book, on one of its front title pages. It is usually a big scene of the book, or a portrait of the writer. In older times, the picture of the writer was more often used. This was because it was less costly, and could be used again for the writer's other books. Frontispieces were often used in scholarly books and Bibles, and many are fine works of art.
Bookkeeping	Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions. Transactions include sales, purchases, income, and payments by an individual or organisation. The persons who do this job are called bookkeepers. They use one of several methods, such as single-entry and double-entry bookkeeping. With proper bookkeeping, companies are able to track all information on its books to make key operating, investing, and financing decisions. Proper bookkeeping gives companies a reliable measure of their performance. It also provides information to make general strategic decisions and a benchmark for its revenue and income goals.
Boot loader	A boot loader is a computer program on your computer. It starts other programs, namely Operating system. Boot loaders run booting instructions so your operating system works and appears. This makes using your computer much easier than it would be otherwise. Boot loaders work on all, or almost all, systems, from Master boot record (Master Boot Record) to UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). If a boot loader does not work on your system, you may need to install a different one, use a different configuration, or fix the one it came with. One of the most common boot loaders is the Windows Boot Manager, also known as bcdboot. It is the only official boot loader for Windows. It also comes preinstalled. Most of the time, there is no real reason to alter it. If you do alter it without full understanding, it is very hard to fix. A common boot loader on Linux is the GRand Unified Bootloader Two, commonly known as GRUB2 or just GNU GRUB. Other boot loaders include systemd-boot, syslinux, and LILO.
Booting	Booting is what happens when a computer starts. This happens when the power is turned on. It is called "reboot" if it happens at other times. When you boot a computer, your processor looks for instructions in system ROM (the BIOS) and executes them. They normally 'wake up' peripheral equipment and search for the boot device. The boot device either loads the operating system or gets it from someplace else. People use the word "boot" to mean "to start a computer" or other device with electronics built in. For example, if a person wants to ask a friend to turn on a satellite phone, they would say "could you boot up the satellite phone?". Most operating systems call the first data storage device it uses a boot device. It may also be called a bootstrap loader. This is because the computer is making itself go, as in the idiom. When we start a computer, we can often see the simple instructions the computer uses to start, then more complicated pictures or software. The phrase "to boot" in this meaning is short for "to bootstrap". This use is part of net jargon along with similar multi-use words like Internet or World Wide Web. Often the computer is just called a box, so a phrase like "to boot the box" means "to start the computer". The term "reboot" can also be used in a different context to mean a restarting of a storyline established in previous iterations of a series of fiction.

Bot	A bot is a computer program which acts automatically. It may do things that a person wouldn't normally do, or take a long time to do. It is an automated or semi-automated tool or script. They may be simple, or advanced and complex:
Botany	Botany is the study of plants. It is a science. It is a branch of biology, and is also called plant biology. It is sometimes called phytology. Scientists who study botany are called botanists. They study how plants work.
Brackish water	Brackish water (less commonly brack water) is salt water and fresh water mixed together. It is salinity than fresh water, but not as salty as salt water. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuary, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. Some human activities can produce brackish water, mostly certain civil engineering projects such as Dike (construction) and the flooding of coast marshland to produce brackish pools for freshwater prawns. Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or ‰). Thus, brackish covers a range of Salinity#Systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.
Brief (law)	In law a brief is a formal written argument submitted to a court. It is in a format required by that particular court system. in Civil law (common law) A brief generally contains the legal arguments in a lawsuit. In a criminal procedure briefs involve the state Prosecutor one or more defendants for breaking one or more laws. In general, briefs contain references to the statutes, legal precedents and arguments applied to the facts for this particular case. When an attorney writes a brief, they are ly promising to give the court good reasons for ruling in favor of their client. An appellate brief is a brief prepared for an appellate court. An amicus curiae, literally a "friend of the court", is a third party not involved in the case but who has a strong interest in the case. They may ask the court's permission to file an amicus brief in support of one of the Party (law).<ref name=amicus/>
Broca's area	Broca's area is a region in the brain of humans and other hominids. It is in the frontal lobe of the dominant Cerebral hemisphere, usually the left. It works as part of "speech production". Language processing has been linked to Broca's area after Pierre Paul Broca. Broca did autopsy on patients who had difficuty speaking when they were alive. He found damage to a particular area of the brain. They had lost the ability to speak after injury to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain. Since then, the region he identified has become known as Broca's area. The deficit in language production is Broca's aphasia, also called 'expressive aphasia'.<ref name="pmid17405763" /> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified activation patterns in Broca's area associated with various language tasks. However, slow destruction of the Broca's area by brain tumors can leave speech relatively intact. This suggests that, given time, its functions can shift to nearby areas in the brain.
Brownout (electricity)	A brownout is a drop of voltage in an electrical power supply. Brownouts may be done intentionally in order to reduce the load during an emergency. This is done to prevent a total Power outage ("blackout"). Brownouts can also be caused accidentally by Fault (power engineering) in the electrical grid which cause a drop in voltage.
Browser	A browser is a name given to any animal, usually a herbivorous mammal, which eats leaves and shrubs rather than grass. It is contrasted with grazers, which eat grass.
Browser game	A browser game is a video game that is played on a web browser. It is different from other console game and personal computer games in that it normally does not need any software to be installed on the user's computer, except for the web browser. There are games that rely solely on client-side technologies such as JavaScript or common plugins such as Java applet or Adobe Flash Player, whereas some employ server-side scripting. The latter case consists typically of (massively multiplayer online game) multiplayer games, whereas the client-side games are typically single-player games. A game played in a browser is often called a browser-based game.<ref></ref> Post-2010, browser games written in other formats besides Flash remain popular, such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly. The most know games are Slither.io, Agar.io, Sigmally.
Brute force attack	A brute force attack is a term in cryptanalysis. It means trying to break a coded cyphertext by trying a lot of possibilities with fast computers. For example, a large number of the possible key (cryptography)s are tried in the key space. If successful , this Encryption the encrypted message.
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo	"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a sentence that uses correct grammar. It is often used as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create confusing, hard-to-understand sentences. It has been talked about since 1967, when the sentence was used by Dmitri Borgmann in his book Beyond Language. Later, in 1972, the sentence was used by William J. Rapaport. Rapaport is a professor at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York. The sentence does not have punctuation. It uses three different meanings of the word "buffalo". They are:
Bugzilla	Bugzilla is an internet software for recording bug reports. It is coded in CGI and is used by many programmers. It is open source for everyone to use without having to pay any money.
Building design	This article is about Sustainable Building Design in Australia. It explains the services offered by a Building Designer. The article outlines what a sustanable building designer does for their clients and explains specialties of sustainable building design. For Architecture see Architecture.
Building model	A building model is either a Matter (real) or Computer model (computer) model of a building. Very often, the physical model is smaller than the original (scale model). There are three basic types of building models: architectural, structural engineering and mathematical model (virtual).
Bullying	Bullying is repeatedly hurting or intimidating specific people who are considered weaker. The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say or do. Bullying includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better. It's also bullying when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble. School teachers and Employee have tried to learn ways to stop bullying. However, bullying can be easy to hide. Some countries and regions have Law against it.
Burning Man	Burning Man is a festival that happens every year at Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, in the United States. It lasts a week, and it starts on the last Monday in August, and ends on the first Monday in September (which is also Labor Day in the U.S.). The festival is called Burning Man because a large wood sculpture of a man is set on fire on Saturday. The festival has been happening every year since 1990. Many people go to Burning Man; in 2012, over 55,000 people were there. The Black Rock desert is far from any cities or towns, and is very dry, so people who go to Burning Man have to bring their own water, food, and shelter.
Busbar	A busbar (or bus bar) is a strip of metal used to electrical conductor within an electrical substation, distribution board, electric switchboard or other electrical equipment. A busbar is usually a flat or hollow piece of copper, brass or aluminium. It allows heat to be released quickly because of its relatively large surface area.
Bushfire	A bushfire is a wildfire that happens mostly in the Australian The Bush. Bush is the word for scrubland, woodland or grassland of Australia and New Zealand. In south east and south west of Australia, bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn. In the north of Australia, bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season. Many Australian plants burn easily. Eucalyptus trees have a high oil content which makes them burn.But these figures do not include the 173 people who died and the 2000 homes destroyed in the 2009 Victorian bushfires. They can also kill wildlife including rare koalas.
Byzantine art	Byzantine art means the Christian Greek art of the Byzantine Empire from about the 5th century until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is known as the Byzantine Empire.) But the term can also be for other the art of countries who shared their culture with the Byzantine Empire. This can include Bulgaria, Serbia, and Rus. The Republic of Venice and Kingdom of Sicily, can also be included even though they were part of western European culture. Art produced by Balkan and Anatolian Christians who lived in the Ottoman Empire is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain traditions that began in the Byzantine Empire, particularly icon painting and church architecture, are still current in Greece, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries.

CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala	The CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala (formerly Sabena Flight Academy Africa) (CAE SFA-A) is an aviation school (part of CAE Global Academy). It is in Douala, Cameroon. It was the first civil aviation university in Cameroon. The school was a subsidiary of Sabena Flight Academy. It trains pilots, flight attendants (preparation of the Certificat de formation à la sécurité) and flight dispatchers.
CCTV New Year's Gala	The China Central Television New Year's Gala (Simplified Chinese: 中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会; Traditional Chinese: 中國中央電視台春節聯歡晚會; Pinyin: Zhōngguó zhōngyāng diànshìtái chūnjié liánhuān wǎnhuì) is a Chinese New Year special produced by China Central Television. It was presented by Zhao Zhongxiang.
CLS Group	CLS (originally Continuous Linked Settlement) is a specialist US financial institution that provides Settlement (finance) services to its members in the foreign exchange market (FX). Although the forex market is decentralised and has no central exchange or clearing facility, firms that chose to use CLS to settle their FX transactions can mitigate the settlement risk associated with their trades. CLS does this through the operation of a payment versus payment (PvP) settlement service which mitigates settlement risk for the FX transactions of its settlement members and their customers (third parties). The service started operating in 2002 as an Edge Act Corporation, a limited purpose bank regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Since it began operations in 2002, CLS has rapidly become the market-standard for foreign exchange settlement. As a result, the Financial Stability Oversight Council officially designated CLS a Systemically important financial market utility in July 2012. The single day record for gross-value settlement, set on 19 March 2008, stands at US$10.3 trillion, for 1,113,464 payment instructions. The single day record for gross-volume settlement, set on 28 May 2013, is 1,992,652. In 2002 CLS was launched with 39 Members and seven currencies. As of November 2015 CLS settles 18 Currencies, has 74 Shareholders, 64 Settlement Members and over 9,000 active Third Party participants. Members include:

Cable internet	Cable is a way to provide Internet to homes and businesses through a coaxial cable . Because cable internet uses existing Cable television, it can service large areas without building new wires, especially in the United States.
Cable modem	A cable modem is a modem that can be used to deliver (usually digital) Information over Cable television infrastructure. Most of the time, cable modems are used to get access to the internet using the cable television network. To do this, cable modems use some Television channel of the Cable TV network. A cable modem usually translates the signal (electrical engineering)s it receives from Ethernet or USB into Radio frequency channels. With Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, most cable modems can now also provide telephone lines. In terms of network technology, a cable modem is a network bridge. It operates at layer 2 of the OSI model.
Cable tray	A cable tray is a system to put Insulator (electricity) cables and other Electrical wiring (communication, network etc.) in building structures, such as in office buildings, Residential area, industry etc. A cable tray system gives easy access. This is useful when adding new cables or replacing the old cables on the tray. Cable trays can be made out of Galvanizing steel, stainless steel, aluminum or plastic. The choice depends on how it will be used or where it will be placed.
Caesar cipher	In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is an ancient form of substitution cipher. It is named in the honor of Roman emperor, Julius Caesar
Calabi-Yau manifold	A Calabi–Yau manifold, or 'Calabi–Yau space', is a special type of manifold. It is described in certain branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry. The Calabi–Yau manifold's properties, such as Ricci flatness, have applications in theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime might take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This led to the idea of string theory mirror symmetry.

Calmerry Platform	Calmerry is the US online therapy platform. It is owned and operated by Mental Fuel Inc., a Delaware corporation. The company operates in the Health care industry. The clients are connected with the mental health professionals in virtual therapy space. The main office is located in Cody, Wyoming
Camouflage	Camouflage is a visual . Without it, an animal would be easily. If the natural colour of an animal makes it look like its surroundings, that is camouflage. A tiger's stripes in the long grass, and the battledress of a modern soldier are examples. Camouflage is a form of . The word camouflage comes from the French language word camoufler, which means "to disguise".
Capacitance	Capacitance is the ability of a body to store electric charge. A common device to do such task is a capacitor. The International System of Units for capacitance is farad. C =\frac QV Where Q is the charge in the object and V is voltage across that object.
Cape	A cape can mean any outer piece of clothing that has no sleeves. However, it usually it is long and covers only the back half of the wearer, It fastens around the neck. Capes were common in medieval Europe, especially when combined with a hood. Capes have had periodic returns to fashion. Roman Catholic clergy wear a type of cape known as a ferraiolo, which is worn for formal events. Capes are often used as rain wear in various military units and police forces. In modern times, comic-book superhero, such as Superman and Batman, are often shown wearing capes.
Captivity narrative	Captivity narratives are stories of people by enemies who are not civilization. Historians - people who study history - do not trust a lot of these stories. A lot of them are not written from a neutral point of view. Some historians that study Native American cultures are careful when they use these stories as sources. Captivity narratives from North America were published through the 18th and 19th centuries. They are a part of English literature, and more stories were written in India and East Asia later on.
Caracol Televisión	Caracol Televisión is the most viewed national television network in Colombia, founded in 1969 and Caracol Internacional (television channel). The Grupo Santodomingo is the Caracol Televisión's (or Canal Caracol) main actionist.
Caracol, Nord-Est	Caracol, Nord Est, also known as Trou Du Nord is part of Haiti's well known area for Agriculture. Its character strives for the benefits of what Family stands for. Hand in hand Lui'nion Fait La Force. Trou du Nord is regard and observed as the home centre of Haiti's President Jovenel Moise who was born June 26 l968. Jovenel Moise is a renown business man who joined Haiti's presidential party of Tet Kate Kale. His presidential party begun in Feb 7, 2017. His aspirations started with the determination to bring Haiti's pep(people) together, to unify the country specifically from an economical structure since that's where Haiti needs to focus on. The main economical structure of Haiti's dependence from a foundational perspective on the stand of monetary needs is agriculture as stated before. With any country whether home or abroad agriculture is what keeps a nation going. Almost every " developed" countries hides this simple truth because they have stolen from many of what is term uncolonized countries in order to fuel their countries. Since they have stolen so much from Haiti what we see in the media as success from these " "developed" countries are a result of their piracy. In turn when we look at these " developed nations we see glamour, wealth, or what many of us would grasped as bling bling. Lets bear in mind these "developed" political nations does not partake in agriculture which is the foundation for any nations ability to strive and live. These "developed" nations replacement of agriculture is plastic food and lab made food. Their since of agriculture has been far removed from them. Haiti's s main focus is agriculture a should any nation in order to excel. If it appears that haiti is not benefiting much from "glamour's" life such as the " developed" nations are know that is why. when you open that television remember you are watching thievery masked as glamour; when any persons travel abroad they see a much "refiner nation/s" as a result of such thievery. The " undeveloped" nations are the reason for such glamour or thievery portrayed for the masses. Jovenel Moise, the president of Haiti represents a nation moving forward however little the progress is; as many of us know that its people is waking up from a system of souse peze for hundreds of years. Indeed, the entire globe has been rob by these "developed" countries and sadly Haiti was no exception. what set Haiti apart from other nations that has been robed by these" developed" nations is it is Luinion Fait La Force and that is the basis for Jovenel Moise place in the Party of Tet Kale. often we see and note that Haiti is one of the poorest country in the western Hemisphere, how can that be when Haiti is Haiti. Haiti made its mark as the pearl of the globe after all.
Carbocation	A carbocation is an ion with a positive charge-Electric charge carbon atom. The charged carbon atom in a carbocation is a "sextet" (that is, it has only six electrons in its outer Electron shell#Valence shells instead of eight valence electrons.) Carbon atoms with eight valence electrons have the maximum (octet rule). Therefore, carbocations are often reactive, seeking to fill the octet of valence electrons as well as regain a neutral electric charge. Logic would say that carbocation have Electron configuration hybrid orbital with an empty sp3 orbital giving positive charge. However, the chemical reactivity of a carbocation more closely resembles Orbital hybridization with a trigonal planar molecular geometry.
Carbon footprint	The term carbon footprint is how much carbon goes into the air because of something done by people or that is not done by nature. Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas (CO2). It is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint, burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air, which is called a carbon footprint. Total carbon footprint/emission would include energy emissions from human activities - that is, from heat, light, power and refrigeration and all transport related emissions from cars, freight and distribution. The words "carbon footprint" are often seen in the news. They are used with the word sustainability, which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen. That is, if there is too much of a carbon footprint, then there is no sustainability. People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air, and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming. This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car, because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas.
Cardigan (sweater)	A cardigan is a type of knitted sweater that has an open front. Commonly cardigans have buttons: a garment that is tied is instead considered a robe. A more modern version of the garment has no buttons and hangs open by design. The name "Cardigan" is an anglicised variation of the Welsh language placename Ceredigion. The term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless vest, but expanded to other types of garment over time. Plain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside Suit (clothing) as a less formal version of the waistcoat or vest that restrains the necktie when the jacket has been removed.
Caricature	A caricature (from the Italian caricatura, which means "loaded portrait") is a portrait or drawing of a person that exaggerates the way they look, usually to create a humorous effect, or a political statement.
Carrot and Stick	The Carrot and Stick refers methods of disciplining children, pets, and other individuals. If you choose the stick (negative feedback) you punish for bad behavior. If you choose the carrot (positive feedback) you reward for good behavior.
Carrying capacity	In ecology, the carrying capacity of an environment is the number of organisms of a particular species that can live there depending on the amount of resources it has. If too many organisms live in an environment, it is called overpopulation. The carrying capacity of an environment can change, and humans can have an effect on the carrying capacity. For example, agriculture and irrigation allow feeding more people; meaning the human carrying capacity is increased. Some things that can change an environment's carrying capacity are pollution and the use of natural resources.
Cartoon series	A cartoon series is a Television series of Animation television programs (cartoons). Episodes are played regularly, and each series will have its own title.
Case citation	Case citation is a system used by legal professionals to identify past court case decisions. These are found either in series of books called Reporter (law) or law reports, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are ted differently in different jurisdictions, but generally contain the same key information. A legal citation is a "reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a legal case, statute, or work, that either agrees with or s a given position". Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
Case law	Case law in a Law are those laws based on previous Judgment (law). This is opposed to decisions based on existing law or s. In countries using common law, it is generally Legal code meaning there are no collections of legal rules and laws to rely on. Instead they rely on legal precedent. Precedents are previous legal cases that are used as examples for deciding the present case. They are also binding on lower courts where the facts and issues are similar. In countries that use civil law, their laws are codified and there is much less on case law.
Catalan solid	Catalan solids are a concept from geometry: For each Archimedean solid there is a Catalan solid that is its dual. In total, there are thirteen Catalan solids (as there are thirtin Archimedean solids). They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan of the 19th centurty.Each Catalan solid is a convex polyhedron. Like with Archimewdean solids, each surface is made of the same shape.
Catalogue of the Archbishops of Gniezno	Catalogue of the Archbishops of Gniezno is a Polish language manuscript.
Catenary	A catenary is a type of curve. An ideal chain hanging between two supports and acted on by a uniform Gravity makes the shape of a catenary. (An ideal chain is one that can bend perfectly, cannot be stretched and has the same density throughout.) The supports can be at different heights and the shape will still be a catenary. A catenary looks a bit like a parabola, but they are different. The equation for a catenary in Cartesian coordinate system is
Catharsis	Catharsis is a term in the Theatre of ancient Greece meaning the purification of Emotion through art. This was the effect of the tragedy as the main and earliest genre of the Greek theatre. It was originally used by Aristotle in the Poetics. It was also used in psychology.
Cathode ray	A cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes. It is called a "cathode ray" because the electrons are being emitted from the negative charged element in the vacuum tube called the cathode. A cathode ray tube aims the ray at a point on its screen. They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays. Electrons were discovered as the constituents of cathode rays in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson. He showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later called the electron. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set. Some properties of cathode rays:
Catia	Catia (Computer Aided Three dimensional Interactive Application) is a commercial designing software. It was made by Dassault Systemes and marketed world-wide by IBM. CATIA is written in C++.
Catsuit	Catsuits are close-fitting one-piece garments that cover the torso and the legs, and often the arms. They are often made with leather, chiffon, latex or spandex materials. The suits usually close with zippers in the front or back. Catsuits were worn as early as the 1940s. They can be worn by males or females. Despite their name, they do not have feline characteristics. Catsuits may also be transparent or completely opaque. Some people consider catsuits to be fetish items.
Cause of action	Under the law, a cause of action is a set of facts to a right to lawsuit to obtain money, property, or the of a right against another party. It means literally the cause or reason why a party can make a legal case under the law. The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings a lawsuit (such as breach of contract, battery (tort), or false imprisonment). The legal document which carries a claim is often called a Statement of Claim in England law, or a Complaint in Federal government of the United States practice and in many States of the United States. A complaint identifies the court's jurisdiction, the d facts and the the plaintiff wants. It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an fault which resulted in s. This is often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay or .
Celery	Celery is a type of vegetable, often used in salad.
Celestia	Celestia is a free software 3D astronomy program for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It was created by Chris Laurel and is licensed under the General Public License. The program is based on the Hipparcos Catalogue (120,000 Stars) and allows users to display objects from satellite (artificial) to entire galaxy in three dimensions in OpenGL. Different from other planetarium software, the user is free to travel in the universe. NASA and European Space Agency have used Celestia, but it is not to be confused with Celestia 2000, ESA's own program.
Celestial coordinate system	A celestial coordinate system is a coordinate system that helps astronomers specify the location of objects in the sky. These objects may be stars, planets or even satellites. There are several such coordinate systems listed below. All of them are Spherical coordinate system. The Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates) divides the celestial sphere into two equal Celestial sphere and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates.
Celestial equator	The celestial equator is a term in observational astronomy. It is a great circle on the imaginary celestial sphere, in the same plane as the Earth's equator. In other words, it is a projection of the terrestrial equator out into space. As a result of the Earth's axial tilt, the celestial equator is inclined by 23.4° with respect to the Ecliptic. An observer standing on the Earth's equator visualizes the celestial equator as a semicircle passing directly overhead through the zenith. As the observer moves north (or south), the celestial equator tilts towards the southern (or northern) horizon. At the Geographical pole, the celestial equator is parallel to the horizon. The observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west, regardless of the observer's position on Earth.
Celestial navigation	Celestial navigation is a method of navigation where a person figures out their and direction using the stars in the night sky. It has been used by sailors to help them find their way in the night. They look for familiar stars or constellations, which will help them find their way. Celestial navigation involves comparing the angle of certain stars to other stars and how high they are above the Earth's horizon. By doing this, a person can find their longitude.
Celestial sphere	In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imagination sphere (ball) of a very large unspecified size. The earth and the sphere have the same centre: they are concentric. They also rotate upon the same axis of rotation. All objects in the sky can be thought of as projective geometry (drawn, written) upon the celestial sphere. This imaginary sphere is a very practical tool for positional astronomy.
Celtic music	Celtic music is the name for a collection of types of music that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the Celtic people of Western Europe.
Cento Pittori via Margutta	Associazione Cento Pittori via Margutta, (Rome 22 June 1970), is a cultural and historical association of painters that exhibits as a Cento Pittori via Margutta mainly in Rome, in via Margutta, whose exhibition origins date back to October 1953.
Central bank	A central bank (or reserve bank) manages a State (polity) currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks usually oversee the bank of their country. It issues the national currency, the nation's money. It controls the overall supply of money. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank can increase or decrease the amount of money in the nation. The oldest central bank is the Bank of England. The largest banks are now the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve of the United States. Central banks usually also have supervisory powers. These powers are meant to prevent bank runs, and to stop commercial banks and other financial institutions doing reckless or fraudulent things. The relation between central banks and governments varies from country to country. The chief executive of a central bank is normally known as the Governor, President or Chairman.
Channel drift	Channel drift, also called network decay, is when a television channel moves away from its original shows to get a new audience, or to get higher ratings. It often involves a move from shows aimed at viewers that know a lot about the channel's subject to shows aimed at a wider audience. Most examples of channel drift have a channel add infotainment or reality television shows to their schedule. A well-known example of channel drift is MTV. When it started in 1981, MTV was a channel that showed music videos. In the 1990s, it started adding entertainment and reality shows aimed at a young adult audience. This was the start of a move towards the channel's current focus on shows aimed at adolescences and young adults.
Chaparral	Chaparral is a shrubland or heathland plant community. It is found mainly in the U.S. state of California. Also in the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. It is caused by a Mediterranean climate (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire. A chaparral has summer drought-tolerant plants. They have hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves. Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California. Of the associated Mediterranean shrubland, it covers an additional 3.5%. There are four other chaparral regions in the world.
Charter Communications	Charter Communications is a cable system group begun in Delaware in 1993. They have Cable television, Internet and telephone services for over 26 million customers in 41 United Statess. The Charter headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut, though many operations remain in St. Louis, Missouri. The company has gotten several awards. But like certain other providers, they have also been under criticism. In May 2016, Charter took over Time Warner Cable and the Bright House Networks; the three companies merged and then became Spectrum.
Chatterbot	A chatterbot is a computer program that responds to input in a natural language processing. An example is ELIZA. ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots. Every year, there is a contest for chatterbots called the Loebner prize.
Checking account	A checking account is a deposit account held at a financial institution that allows withdrawals and deposits. Also called demand accounts or transactional accounts, checking accounts are very liquid and can be accessed using checks, automated teller machines and electronic debits, among other methods. In Britain the term is "current account".
Cheerleader effect	The Cheerleader effect, or group attractiveness effect is a kind of cognitive bias: People who are part of a group are seen as more Physical attractiveness, than those who aren't. This observation is valid for both men and women. The effect was first described in a study done 2013, and the result is backed up by one of 2015. Showing the effect may be difficult: The study done in 2015 was repeated, but did not show the same result. According to the research team, this may be due to Culture differences, since the new study was performed in Japan.
Chehel Sotoun	Chehel Sotoun (or 'Chihil Sutun') is a pavilion in Isfahan (city), Iran. It is in the middle of a park at the end of a long pool. It was built by Shah Abbas II for his entertainment and receptions. In this palace, Shah Abbas II and his successors would receive dignitaries and ambassadors, either on the terrace or in one of the stately reception halls. The name, meaning "Forty Columns" in Persian, was inspired by the twenty slender wooden columns supporting the entrance pavilion, which, when Reflecting pool, are said to appear to be forty. The palace has many frescoes and paintings on ceramic. Many of the ceramic panels are now in the possession of major museums in the west. They show specific historical scenes. There are also aesthetic compositions in the traditional miniature style which celebrate the joy of life and love. The Chehel Sotoun Palace is among the nine Iranian Gardens which are registered as one of the Iran’s 17 World Heritage Sites. The nine gardens go by the name of "The Persian Garden".
Chemical biology	Chemical biology is a science that combines the fields of chemistry and biology. It involves the application of chemical techniques and tools, often compounds produced through chemical synthesis, to the study and of biological systems. It is different from biochemistry. Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of biological molecules. For example, a biochemist studies the three-dimensional structure of a protein and how that structure relates to the chemistry of the protein. Also, biochemistry studies the way enzymes work. Chemical biologists use chemical principles to modulate systems. They do this to either biology relationships or create new functions. In this way, the research done by chemical biologists is often closer to that of cell biology than biochemistry. Biochemists work in the chemistry of biology, but chemical biologists work in chemistry applied to biology.
Chemical education	Chemistry education is the study of the teaching and learning of chemistry. Topics in chemistry education include understanding how students learn chemistry and how best to teach chemistry. s in chemistry education try to improve learning results by improving teaching methods and training chemistry teachers. Researchers study many teaching s, including: classroom lecture, demonstrations, and laboratory activities. There is a world-wide shortage of chemistry teachers. This is because people with science training can get jobs that pay more outside of teaching. It is hard to keep science teachers. More than 45,000 math and science teachers left teaching in the United States just after the 1999–2000 school year.
Chemical energy	Chemical energy is the energy produced in a chemical reaction in the form of heat. Using Hess's law it is possible to calculate the amount of energy an exothermic reaction produces.
Chemical engineering	Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering dealing with chemistry that came to existence in the early 20th century. Before this time, chemical plants were designed by chemists, who were trained to work on a small scale only. Chemical engineering combines the jobs of a chemist and that of manufacturing engineering. This makes factories more efficient and chemicals much cheaper. Chemical engineering uses physics (the science of moving objects and Force (physics)), chemistry (the science of substances), and mathematics. There are many different types of jobs for people with academic degree in chemical engineering. Some new topics in chemical engineering include:
Chemical property	In chemistry, a property is any aspect of a chemical substance which is only seen by means of a chemical reaction. Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance. This is different from a physical property, which can be discovered without changing the substance's chemical structure. Usually a chemical property is discovered by changing the substance's internal structure. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in chemical change. However, a catalytic property would also be a chemical property. Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications. They can be used to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances.
Chemical reaction	A chemical reaction happens when one or more chemicals are changed into one or more other chemicals. Examples:
Chemical similarity	Chemical similarity or molecular similarity is a between two different molecules. Two molecules with chemical similarity may do the same or a very similar thing in an organism. They might also have very similar chemical structures. It can be used to predict the properties of certain chemicals.
Chemical species	A chemical species is one of a group of atoms, molecules, molecular s, ions, etc., made to go through to a chemical process or to a measurement. Generally, a chemical species can be defined as an ensemble of chemically identical molecular entity that can the same set of molecular energy levels on a defined time scale. Chemists also use chemical species to mean a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array. For example, when molecules of NaCl dissolve in water we don't really have any NaCl as such in the solution. We have Na+ and Cl- ions because NaCl dissociates. We say the species present in solution are Na+(aq) and Cl-(aq). In this case, the species present in solution are the ions. In other cases, where the molecules don't dissolve in water, we would have molecular species in solution rather than ionic species. In supramolecular chemistry, chemical species are those supramolecular structures whose interactions and associations are brought about by forming or breaking intermolecular chemical bonds. Studying these actions is the main topic of supramolecular chemistry.
Chemical substance	A chemical substance is any material with a known chemical composition. For example, Water (molecule) has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it came from a river or was made in a laboratory. Typical chemical substances found in the home include water, salt (sodium chloride) and bleach. Generally, substances exist as a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and may change between these phase (matter) when there are changes in temperature or pressure.
Chemistry	Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with chemical elements and Chemical compound, and how they work together and change.
Chemoautotroph	A chemoautotroph is an organism that uses Inorganic chemistry energy sources for food. Then it puts together its own organic compounds using ATP. Chemoautotrophs are mostly bacteria or archaea that live in hostile environments such as deep sea vents. They are the primary producers in such ecosystems.
Chemtrail conspiracy theory	A chemtrail is a trail of chemicals left by an Fixed-wing aircraft at a high altitude. According to a conspiracy theory, the chemicals are said to be deliberately sprayed for reasons that are kept secret by the government. Most scientists and workers in the aviation industry say that the trails left by planes are just a form of condensation. These are called contrails (condensation trails). People who believe the theory have about what purpose chemtrails may serve. Some say it is to Weather modification or stop global warming. Others say that it is to Population control by spreading chemicals that are harmful to the human reproductive system.<ref name="hsw"/> Some more recent versions of the theory say that chemtrails are being spread by companies that make Genetically modified organism (GMO) crops. The chemtrails supposedly contain herbicides that will only kill normal (organic) crops and will not affect the genetically-modified crops. Some claim that specially modified planes, supposedly owned and operated by the government, are necessary to create a chemtrail. The chemicals are said to either come from the Jet engine or from special nozzles on the plane. In some versions of the theory, the chemical is said to be barium or a barium compound, but in other versions it is aluminum oxide, or a mixture of barium compounds and aluminum oxide.<ref name="beacon"/> Chemtrails are not to be confused with the spraying of chemicals over short distances at a low altitude, such as aerial Firefighter or Aerial application.
Child development	Child development refers to biological, psychology and emotional changes that happen in humans between birth and the end of adolescence, at which time the individual goes from dependence to independence. The development is strongly influenced by genetic, mental, physical and social factors that may happen during the progression. Children develop at different levels. In particular, children having autism spectrum troubles or Down syndrome may have different development than usual or substandard motor development. Ideas about how children develop psychologically have changed over time. There are several important theories on how children develop.
Child sexuality	When Child develop into Adult, their Human body will change. So will the way they see their body, and the way their perceive their Human sexuality. Child sexuality is also influenced by Culture and Society values, and by education. Classical psychoanalysis looks at child sexuality, and develops Scientific model how it changes over time.
China Central Television	China Central Television or Chinese Central Television, commonly abbreviated as CCTV, is the major state television network in mainland China. CCTV has a network of 50 channels. Each channel broadcasts different programs to more than one billion viewers. The CCTV programs are a mixture of documentary, comedy, entertainment, and drama.
Chinese architecture	Chinese architecture refers to the architecture of China. Sometimes it might also mean architecture outside of China but built in the same style. Chinese architecture is very influential in East Asia where many other country and cultures' architecture also modeled upon it. Well known example of Chinese architecture are the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City.
Chinese musical system	The ancient Chinese musical system depends on very ancient mathematics used to determine sound frequencies. The easiest way to explain it is to work through a real example. Suppose that somebody wanted to make a musical instrument that could play any song in the ancient Chinese system. Here are the instructions: Make a wooden box 105 cm long and 60 cm wide. Put guides for the strings near each end of the box, and fix it so that these two guides are 99 cm apart.Multiply 99 cm by 2/3, which is 66 cm. Place a fret all the way across the box on the 66 cm line.Multiply 66 cm by 4/3, which is 88 cm. Place a fret along the 88 cm line.Multiply 88 cm by 2/3, which is 58.66...6 cm. Place a fret along this line.Multiply 58.66...6 cm by 4/3, which is 78.22...2 cm. Place a fret along this line. Multiply 78.22...2 cm by 2/3, which is 54.148148...148 cm. Place a fret along this line.Multiply 54.148148...148 cm by 4/3, which is 69.531 cm. Place a fret along this line.Multiply 69.531 cm by 2/3, which is 46.354 -- and which is too short, so double it to get 92.708 cm. Place a fret along this line.Multiply 92.708 cm by 4/3...Multiply the previous answer by 2/3...Keep going until you have put down eleven frets. Counting the frequency on the open string and the frequencies on the fretted strings, for each string there will be 12 defined frequencies. Tune the bottom string to some basic frequency. Tune the next string to the frequency of the bottom string at the first fret. Tune the third string to the bottom string's second fret. Keep going until you have tuned all twelve strings. When you pluck these strings at all the fretted and unfretted positions, you will get 144 frequencies. Some of them will be duplicates, but not as many as you might think because this system is not like the Equal tempered system now used for almost all Western music. Out of each twelve frequencies on a single string, you can make many selections of either five frequencies (for the pentatonic scales) or seven frequencies (for the heptatonic scales). Here is a chart showing how frequencies and scales can be produced. The frequency of 440 hertz could have been any other frequency. Once this frequency is chosen, it is multiplied by the ratios to produce the first column of frequencies. Each of these 12 frequencies is used to start its own column. (See the dotted red line for one example.) Any five frequencies in a column can be chosen to make a pentatonic scale, as long as they are not right together and are not more than two apart. In the United States, students are taught the scale whose notes are named: "do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, and ti." Those seven (known to many from the "Doe, a deer, a female deer" song) produce a major scale. In Western music we also use a minor scale fairly frequently. But we only have those two. Chinese traditional music uses five different scales of five notes each. It also has pentatonic scales, but they are not discussed in this article.
Chinoiserie	Chinoiserie refers to elements in European art that are influenced by China arts. Some of the most prominent examples of Chinoiserie can be found in royal palaces in Europe, such as the Drottningholm Palace in Sweden and Tsarskoye Selo in Russia.
Chloralkali process	The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide, chlorine, and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water. It is normally conducted in a separated by a membrane, although there are other methods, such as using mercury. If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced. When the membrane is not in place, hypochlorites are formed. If it is heated, chlorates are formed. The process is fueled by electrolysis. It can be done in the laboratory.
Chosen-ciphertext attack	A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information, at least in part, by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key. When a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack, implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts (i.e., avoid providing a decryption scheme). This can be more difficult than it appears, as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks. Additionally, some cryptosystems (such as RSA) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them. This permits attacks when cryptographic hash function is not used on the message to be signed. A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provable security under chosen-ciphertext attack, including (among others) Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding, Cramer-Shoup system and many forms of Authentication Symmetric-key algorithm.
Chosen-plaintext attack	A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a model for cryptanalysis which assumes that the attacker can choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the Key (cryptography). Modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of Public-key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose. Any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext attack and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security. Two forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished:
Chromatophore	Chromatophores are pigment-containing and light-reflecting cell (biology) found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, and cephalopods. They are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in Poikilotherm animals. Some species can rapidly change colour so as to keep in camouflage, or to signal. They do this by moving pigment and reflective plates in chromatophores. This process is called physiological colour change. Cephalopods such as octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this. The display is under central nervous control based usually on input from the eyes. Vertebrates such as chameleons get a similar effect by Signal transduction. Such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters. They may be started by changes in mood, temperature, Stress (medicine) or visible changes around the animal.
ChuvashTet	ChuvashTet (short for "Chuvash Internet"), () is the name Chuvash-speaking Internet users commonly use for the segment of the Web about the Chuvash people or Chuvashia. It includes webpages and websites in many languages. Chuvash Internet users employ Latin and Cyrillic scripts.
Cinquillo	The cinquillo is a syncopation rhythm found in a number of Afro-Latin musical styles. It is present in the Cuban habanera and danzón, and in the Argentine tango. It is, with polyrhythms, a characteristic African influence on Latin music.
Ciphertext	In cryptography, ciphertext (or cyphertext) refers to the output of the encryption process. Plaintext is turned into ciphertext using an algorithm (cipher). This makes it unreadable to anyone except those who own unique Information leakage about it, usually referred to as a key (cryptography). Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It takes the unreadable ciphertext as an input and makes it readable again in the form of plaintext.
Ciphertext-only attack	In cryptography, a ciphertext-only attack (COA) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts. The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced (extracted) or, even better, the Key (cryptography). The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success. Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The process of selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise. On the other hand, poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection; for this reason, many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use. Examples include:
Circumference	In geometry, circumference is the distance around a closed curve; for example, a circle. It is a special kind of perimeter. The length of the circumference of a circle is often written as C, with:
Citizenship of the European Union	Citizenship of the European Union was started by the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992. It is extra to being a citizen of one of the member countries of the European Union, and gives extra rights to nationals of European Union Member States.
Civil Aviation University of China	Civil Aviation University of China (Simplified Chinese 中国民航大学, Traditional Chinese 中國民航大學, Pinyin Zhōngguó Mínháng Dàxué), also known as CAUC, is a national university in Tianjin, People's Republic of China. It offers education and training in civil aviation for new pilots in China.
Civil law (common law)	Civil law is a branch of the law in common law countries. The other branch of common law is criminal law. Civil law is concerned with the duties individuals owe to other people or to their government. This excludes the duty not to commit crimes. Two features stand out, class actions and the awarding of punitive damages in tort cases.<ref name=Mehren162/> Many people in other countries are amazed at the number of civil cases in the United States. Americans lawsuit in a wide variety of cases for Damages and medical expenses that are covered in other countries by national health insurance and government compensation programs.<ref name=Mehren162/>
Clairvoyance	Clairvoyance is an ability to know about things or events that will occur in the future. According to psychologists from Yale, human beings first see something happen, then think about seeing it, but sometimes they believe they had the thought first. This, they say, is why some people think they have clairvoyance.
Clandestine chemistry	Clandestine chemistry is chemistry that occurs in a laboratory that is used for making illegal drugs, usually using unsafe equipment. The use of this unsafe laboratory equipment will sometimes result in explosions, fires or heavy flows of poison fumes. Meth labs are the main form of clandestine laboratories and are used for making methamphetamine (Crystal Meth), a kind of illegal drug. "Clandestine" means "".
Classical architecture	Classical architecture is any architecture that has features from the Ancient Greece and Roman Empire style of building. It is also known as the architecture of classical antiquity. Many features of classical architecture come from the writing of the Roman architect Vitruvius. Different styles of classical architecture might have existed since the Carolingian Renaissance. Styles have definitely existed since the Italian Renaissance. Classical architecture buildings can be very different, but all classical architecture uses the same common design features. These features are structural and visual. In much of Western world, from the Renaissance until World War II, classical architecture was very popular and important to architecture. It is still important today, but less than it has been in history. The term classical architecture is also used to talk about any type of architecture that has become a very specific style. For example, Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture. The words "traditional" and "vernacular" can mean something different to "classical", or something similar. The phrases Neoclassicism and Neoclassical describe classical architecture that was built in modern times.
Classical conditioning	Classical conditioning (also Pavlovian conditioning) is a type of learning that happens subconsciously. Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) was the first to show the way in which it works. He did this in an experiment using dogs. Pavlov noticed that the dogs naturally salivated when they saw food. This behaviour did not need to be taught. In this example, the food is an unconditioned Stimulus (psychology). He paired this unconditioned stimulus (showing food to the dogs) with another, neutral stimulus: the ringing of a bell. Pavlov discovered that, if the two stimuli are presented together again and again, the organism learns that they belong together. As a result, it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get a conditioned response or reflex. Classical conditioning is an important factor in everyday life. It can be applied in many areas such as Behaviour therapy, responses to Drug and in modern day marketing strategies. Classical conditioning is different from operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is a different kind of learning. It happens when an individual or animal learns a behaviour as a result of a of that behaviour. For example, a child may learn to open a box to get some sweets. So, when a behaviour has a good result, the organism learns to associate the behaviour with this good result. As such, learning the behaviour and ing it. So, operant conditioning explains changes in behaviour. Classical conditioning explains how reflexes are trained.
Classless Inter-Domain Routing	Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a way of IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. [[it:Supernetting#CIDR]]
Cleaner fish	Cleaner fish are fish that provide a service to other fish species by removing dead skin and ectoparasites. This is an example of mutualism, an ecological interaction that benefits both parties. A wide variety of fishes show cleaning behaviors. They include wrasse, cichlids, catfish, and goby, as well as by a number of different species of cleaner shrimp. There is also at least one predatory Mimicry#Aggressive mimicry, the sabre-toothed blenny. It mimics cleaner fish but in fact bites off pieces of fin.
Clearing bank	A clearing bank is one which moves money between accounts, and issues money to customers. At one time this meant taking in and giving out actual money. Now it means any kind of financial transaction. In banking and finance, clearing means all activities from the time a commitment is made for a transaction until it is settled. This process turns the promise of payment (for example, in the form of a cheque or electronic payment request) into the actual movement of money from one account to another. In the UK they are officially called a Cheque and Credit Clearing Company. In the United States the Federal Reserve performs an intermediary role, clearing and settling international bank payments.
Cleartext	In telecommunications, cleartext is the form of a message or data which is in a form that is immediately understandable to a human being without additional processing. In particular, it implies that this message is sent or stored without cryptography protection. The phrases, "in clear", "en clair" and "in the clear" are the same. It is close to, but not entirely the same as, the term "plaintext". Formally, plaintext is information that is fed as an input to a coding process, while ciphertext is what comes out of that process. Plaintext might be compressed, coded, or otherwise changed before it is converted to ciphertext, so it is quite common to find plaintext that is not cleartext. Websites using insecure HTTP send using cleartext, with all data supplied (including usernames and passwords) being sent from the user's computer through the internet using cleartext. Anyone with access to the medium used to carry the data (the routers, computers, telecommunications equipment, wireless transmissions, and so on) may read the password, username, and anything else sent to the website.
Cleavage	Cleavage is the low-cut in women's clothing, partially revealing the women's Breast. It is also used with an Eroticism purpose. In 1805, in geology and mineralogy, cleavage meant "tendency (of rocks or Jewel) to break cleanly along natural fissures." General meaning "action or state of cleaving or being cleft" is from 1867. The sense of "cleft between a woman's breasts in low-cut clothing" is first recorded 1946, defined in a "Time (magazine)" magazine article.<ref name=":0" />
Client	In net jargon (words people use about the Internet) a client is a computer used by a user to connect to a network and make requests to servers. For example, a web browser is a client software.
Climax community	In ecology, climax community is a term for a stable biological community of plants, animals and fungi. After a process of ecological succession the vegetation in an area reaches a steady state. Its stability is not guaranteed: invasive species and climate change can cause changes. However, relatively, the system is stable. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area. The term is sometimes also applied in soil development. The idea of a single climatic climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with Frederic Clements in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by Henry Cowles in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.
Clinical psychology	Clinical psychology is the study in psychology of mental disorders. It is about learning, understanding, diagnosing, treating or preventing these types of illnesses. Clinical psychologists examine the mental functioning of a person and use psychotherapy to treat the disorder. Psychotherapy uses talking instead of medical or physical treatments.The first psychological clinic opened in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer.In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology mainly about psychological assessment, not treatment. After World War II, there was a big increase in the numbers of trained clinical psychologists. There are two main educational models - the Ph.D. scientist-practitioner model which looks at research, and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model which looks at treatment. Clinical psychologists are now regarded as experts in psychotherapy.
Cloak	A cloak is a type of loose garment. It is worn over indoor clothing. It protects a person, for example from cold or rain. It may be part of an outfit or uniform. Cloaks have been used by many historical societies. Their designs, over time, have been changed to match fashion and available textiles. Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder. They can be different lengths, from hip all the way down the ankle. They may have an attached hood. They may fasten down the front. Cloaks are almost always sleeveless.
Close-up	A close-up or closeup in filmmaking, television production, photography, and the comic strip medium is a type of shot (filmmaking) that tightly movie frame a person or object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with medium and long shots.
Clothes dryer	A clothes dryer or tumble dryer is a machine that is used to remove water from clothing after it is laundry. A dryer has a rotating cylinder called a "drum' that holds clothes and lets hot air in to evaporation the water. Then the heated air and water vapor exit through a vent. The drum spins so that the clothing stays apart making the hot air work better. Dryers can use electricity to both operate the machine and create heat to dry the clothes. Others use natural gas to create the heat. Ventless clothes dryers work differently since they cannot vent the hot air. The two types of ventless dryers are condensation dryers and heat pump dryers.<ref name=LeveretteAC/> Condensation dryers heat the air the same as a regular dryer, but use a heat exchanger. The air is cooled and the water goes down a drain. A heat pump dryer works similarly but passes the air a heat pump.<ref name=LeveretteAC/> The water either goes down the drain or into a Storage tank.
Clothing	Clothing is an item or fabric, usually sewn together to cover part of the human body. Humans are the only animals which wear clothing, and all people do wear suitable clothing. The torso (body) can be covered by shirts, arms by sleeves, legs by pants or skirts, hands by gloves, feet by footwear, and head by Hat or masks. In cold climates, people also wear heavy, thick coats such as trenchcoats. Clothing protects the human body from the hot sun and high temperatures in warm tropics countries. Clothing such as thick wool coats and boots keeps the human body warm in very cold temperatures (such as in the arctic). To some extent, clothing protects people from damage to their body. Clothing is also worn for decoration, as a fashion (clothing). People from different cultures wear different clothing, and have different beliefs and customs about what type of clothing should be worn.For many people, clothing is a status symbol. It helps people project an image. Often, clothing is a form of self-expression. Adults in different social or work situations present different views of themselves by the clothes they wear. Young people have an entirely different form of dress to express their personalities. Often people will simply follow popular fashion styles so that they will fit in. Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies.
Cloud computing	Cloud computing is when computing services are provided by a company or place outsourcing. It is like the way in which Electric power distribution: they simply use the electricity that is sent to them and do not need to worry where the electricity is from or how it is made and brought to them. Every month, they pay only for what they used and nothing more. The idea behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use storage, computing Central processing unit, or Software development environments, without having to worry how they work behind the scenes. The cloud is a metaphor for the Internet based on how it is described in computer network diagrams. Just as how in the real world, Cloud hide parts of the sky from sight, the cloud in computing hides the complex infrastructure that makes the Internet work. It is a type of computing in which Information technology actions are provided “Everything as a service”, allowing users to access these services through the Internet ("in the cloud"). They do not have to know or control the Technology behind them, preventing them from running into Ethics and Law problems. According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, cloud computing is a paradigm where information is placed on servers and sent over the Internet to other devices, such as computers, laptops, handhelds, and sensors. It includes the idea of having software as a service (SaaS), such as Web 2.0, that depend on the Internet to meet the needs of their users. For example, Google has made several office suite apps which are accessed from a web browser. Unlike other software that does the same tasks, including Microsoft Office, the software and Information are stored on Google's servers, not on the machine in which they are used.
Coat	A coat is a piece of clothing that is worn over a person's upper body. It can be used to keep warm or [[:wikt:dry|dry]] (a raincoat). It also may be worn to make a person look good. A coat usually has long sleeves, and is fastened at the front. Sometimes it includes collar, shoulder straps and hoods. One type of coat is a jacket.
Cocktail party effect	When they are in a Noise environment, Human have the ability to focus their hearing onto one source. This phenomenon is called cocktail party effect. It is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation they are doing, and disregard the other conversations. It has been proposed that one's Sensory memory parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to "tune into" a single voice and "tune out" all others. This phenomenon is often described in terms of "selective attention" or "selective hearing". It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli, for example hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input. An inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness.
Code	A code is a way of changing information into something else. Sometimes this is done as a way of keeping a message secret. This is called encryption or cryptography.One source gives this explanation: a code is "a word, number or some other symbol used to represent a word, phrase or syllable in plaintext". It is one of the earliest forms of cryptography. Contrast code with cypher, in which the individual letters are encrypted (changed). Sometimes it is done as an easier way of sending a message. For example, when people on two different boats want to send a message, they may be too far away to shout, but they can send messages with a flag code. Another code that people use is called Morse code, which changes letters to dots and dashes, like this: SOS: ···−−−··· Computers use codes, by changing letters into 1's and 0's. This method was invented for punched tape. Now the usual alphanumeric code is ASCII. Some people write codes as a kind of game. They think it is fun to make ciphers, and fun to break them. Breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works, and then you can understand messages that are written in that code. Cryptanalysis is also serious business. Nations and other organizations have been breaking each other's ciphers for many centuries. The algorithm (code) for making a message secret is called the encryption algorithm. To change a secret message back a decryption algorithm is needed.
Code talker	A code talker was a person who was hired by the United States military during wartime to use a little-known language as a means of secret communication. The term is now usually known with United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages. About 400 to 500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was to transmit secret Military tactics messages. The code talkers improved the speed of encryption and decryption of communications in front line operations during World War II. Native soldiers developed two types of Native American Code Talking (NACT). First developed by Choctaw in World War I, Type one NACT contained coded vocabulary, collections of words or phrases that were assigned to military subjects, within their languages. Type two NACT simply used existing Native languages. Both forms worked as codes because they were based on languages unknown to the enemy and, as the new codes were not based on mathematical processes as found in most code and cipher systems, the enemy had nothing to which to compare them. During World War II, Comanche soldiers created about 250 coded terms, while Navajo soldiers eventually developed more than 700 terms. Many terms were based on everyday things in the tribal communities such as animals, food, material items and descriptions. Examples of code terms include the Comanche terms for tank (“wakaree’e” or “turtle”) and telephone exchange (“puhihwi tekwapu kahni” or “metal talking house”); the Hopi terms for ship (“pa-a-ki-hu” or “houses on water”) and the M-1 rifle (mouth and one); and the Navajo term for grenade (“ni-ma-si” or “potatoes”). A 1941 edition of the journal “The Masterkey” reports that one of the tribes in the Chippewa and Oneida group developed terms based on the colors of military hat cords and other insignia, with the Native word for “blue” meaning infantry, “yellow” meaning cavalry and “red” for artillery. The Comanche even had a code name for Adolf Hitler—“Po’sa taiboo’” (Crazy White Man). Hopi, Meskwaki and Canadian Cree also had specially devised code terms, although the number is unknown. Eight Hopi code talkers were in the 81st Division. Although Frank Chapella, Franklin Shupla and Warren Koopyaquaptewa were all from the village of Tewa, they were both Tewa and Hopi and so spoke both of these tribes’ languages. Frank Chapella’s wife, Elidia Chapella, and his son, Marshall Shupla, recall how these three individuals spoke to one another in Tewa (their matrilineal classification through their mothers) and in Hopi with the other five members of their unit. Some Type one NACT groups like the Comanche and Navajo also developed alphabet systems, using the first letter of English words translated from Native words to spell out names of individuals and locations. For example, the translation of the Comanche words for pear, ant, rain, ice and snake could be combined to convey “Paris.” While the Comanche used an open system by using any word that translated to the desired letter, the Navajo developed a set vocabulary, such as “wol-la-chee” (ant) for the letter a, “shush” (bear) for b, “moasi” (cat) for c and so on. Later they developed three interchangeable words for each English letter. Both systems prevented repetition and inhibited breaking of the code. One of the benefits of using these codes derived from Native language was open-air messages could be sent faster, often in one to two minutes compared to existing encryption methods requiring up to four hours to craft, communicate and decode. NACT messages were typically brief—usually less than three lines—to avoid creating radio congestion, drawing enemy attention, providing repetition or giving the enemy more transmissions to analyze. “Whenever we sent a message it was short, sweet and to the point,” Comanche code talker Roderick Red Elk noted. Because of the speed of their communications, code talkers were especially important in relaying information and conveying orders that needed immediate implementation or response, such as troop movement, enemy resistance, evacuation of wounded and directing artillery, ammunition and other supplies. “It was in these defensive positions where you used it quite a bit,” Comanche code talker Forrest Kassanavoid said. “All critical information, something they felt was really top secret, was in Comanche.” During 1943 and 1944, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps representatives considered increasing their numbers of American Indian code talkers. However, Army and Navy leaders were skeptical the code talkers’ messages were secure and decided not to expand their units. The Marine Corps expressed optimism but kept silent about its growing program. Despite these decisions, several Army and Army Air Forces units each had small groups of Native communicators. In the Pacific, seven Lakota soldiers in the 302nd Reconnaissance Troop became known as “MacArthur’s Boys,” while the 5th Bomb Command in the 5th Army Air Force had a radio net of 15 Native Americans who sent radio communications in Acoma-Laguna, Apache, Crow, Hopi, Lakota and other Native languages. In the Pacific, the Navajo, the largest group of code talkers, served in every major campaign, from the battle on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands from August 1942 to February 1943 to the conflicts on Okinawa, which lasted from April to June 1945.
Code-switching	Code-switching is an ability when a person mixes more than one language or lect when they talk.
Cogeneration	Cogeneration (also combined heat and power, CHP) is the use of a heat engine or a power station to make both electricity and useful heat at the same time. Conventional power plants emit the heat created as a byproduct of electricity generation into the environment through cooling towers, as flue gas, or by other means. Combined heat and power captures the byproduct heat for domestic or industrial heating purposes, either very close to the plant, or - especially in Scandinavia and eastern Europe - for distribution through pipes to district heating. Byproduct heat at moderate temperatures (100 to 180°C) can also be used in Gas-absorption refrigerator for cooling. A plant producing electricity, heat and cold is sometimes called regeneration or more generally: polygene ration plant. Cogeneration is a thermodynamics efficiency use of fuel. In separate production of electricity some energy is lost as waste heat, but in cogeneration this energy performs useful work (see energy).
Cognition	Cognition is the scientific word for the thought process. This process is the way we think. The word comes from the Latin word cognoscere, which means "to know" or "to recognize". Cognitive psychology is the science which studies cognition.
Cognitive bias	A cognitive bias happens when someone makes a bad choice that they think is a good choice. This bias is an important part of the study of cognitive psychology. Cognitive biases are often because of evolution. Some behaviors were good for Human evolution and animals that seem foolish today. The scientific method limits the results of cognitive bias.
Cognitive dissonance	Cognitive dissonance is a concept in social psychology. It is the discomfort felt by a person who holds conflicting ideas, beliefs or values at the same time. In this state, people may feel surprise, dread, Guilt (emotion), anger, or embarrassment. Reacting to this unpleasant state, people have a Motivation to reduce dissonance. Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance was developed to predict and explain how people reacted to this situation. Cognitive dissonance theory says that people have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality. According to Festinger, people engage in a process he termed "dissonance reduction". This can be got in one of three ways:
Cognitive distortions	Cognitive distortions are or exaggeration thoughts that can cause some psychology problems to become worse. By following these wrong thought, they make if very hard to do the things they want to do. This may cause problems such as Depression (mood). There are many forms of cognitive distortions. Some of these include:
Cognitive neuropsychology	Cognitive neuropsychology is a in psychology. It is a combination of biology and cognitive psychology. These psychologists study human behavior and knowledge. This is a growing subject that is used more and more everyday. Unlike cognitive neuroscience, cognitive neuropsychology pays attention to the mind rather than the brain. Many scientists have worked to make cognitive neuropsychology. Their findings have created an understanding of the brain and how humans learn and do things. Most of these scientists were not psychologists, but are known for their contributions to psychology. The technology today also helps advance what is known. With brain and other methods the brain can now be visualized. Cognitive neuroscience can also be broken into different topics such as memory, , language, and emotion.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy which aims to help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being. Psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge, then challenge those Cognitive distortions, feelings and behaviors. CBT refers to many types of psychotherapy systems that deal with cognitions, interpretations, beliefs and responses. These systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, combining them. CBT has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods. It has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense. Research shows that CBT is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety. CBT alone is 50-75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after 5 – 15 modules. Medication alone is effective, however, science still does not understand the long-term effects on the brain and body. There is evidence which suggests that CBT may be more cost-efficient in the long run in comparison to medication. Although, a combination of medication and CBT seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness. In particular, Antidepressant paired with CBT could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression. CBT is often recommended for mood-related disorders such as Depression (mental illness) and anxiety, but it can also treat Personality disorder, Post-traumatic stress disorder and Eating disorder. CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online.
Collar	In clothing, a collar is the part of a shirt, dress, coat or blouse that goes around or frames the neck. A collar may also be a separate or detachable item around the neck.
Collective unconscious	Collective unconscious refers to the things in the unconscious mind that are shared between beings of the same species. The term was made by Carl Jung. He said that the human collective unconscious is made up of Instinct and Archetype. An archetype is a universal symbol. Some of the archetypes that Carl Jung talked about were The Great Mother, the Wise Old Man, the Shadow (psychology), Water, and the Tree of Life (psychology). He Argument that the collective unconscious had a Size influence on Human Life. Critic of the idea say that it is Pseudoscience, Fate, or very hard to test scientifically.
Collimated light	Collimated light is light whose ray (optics) are parallel. This light spreads slowly as it travels. The word collimated is related to collinear, because all the rays in collimated light line up with each other. Perfectly collimated light would not spread out with distance at all. No real light is perfectly collimated. Real light will spread a little as it travels. Diffraction prevents anyone from creating a perfectly collimated beam. Light can be roughly collimated by using a collimator – a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves.
Colloquialism	A colloquialism is a word that is not used in formal speech, writing or paralinguistics. Colloquialisms are also sometimes referred to collectively as "colloquial language". Colloquialisms or colloquial language is considered to be characteristic of or only appropriate for casual, ordinary, family, or information conversation rather than formal speech or writing. Dictionary often mark colloquial words and phrases with the abbreviation colloq. as an identifier.
Color television	Color television is a television transmission technology that includes information on the color of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set. It was an upgraded form from black and white to color transmission in the 1960s to the 1980s. The invention of color television standards is an important part of the history of television, and it is described in the technology of television article.
Comcast	Comcast Corporation is the biggest cable television company, the second biggest Internet service provider and the third biggest telephone company in the United States.
Comic strip	A comic strip is a series of panels with cartoon drawings in them that make a story. Sometimes comic strips are humorous, and sometimes they are serious. Famous examples of comic strips are:
Comics	In Comics, stories or information are given using pictures, or pictures and words together. In comics, a story is told with many pictures, mostly in panels. The first panel is supposed to be read first, and takes place earlier in time than the panels that follow it. There are many kinds of comics. Comic strips are short comics which are often found in newspapers. Comic books are thin comics magazines. Graphic novels are books of comics. In Japan, comics are very popular, and Japanese comics are popular around the world. The japanese language word for comics is manga, and people use this word for Japanese comics in English and other languages. The first comic strips in the United States were funny. "Comic" is another word for "funny", so they were called "comic strips". The first comic books were collections of comic strips. Today, many comics are serious, but they are still called "comics". In comics, speech is usually shown through bubbles. There are many different kinds of word balloons, such as the "speech balloon", the "thought balloon" and the "scream balloon".
Commentary	A commentary often means some sort of voice that will explain what is going on while a television programme is playing. Commentary is most often used in sports. Some famous commentators are Jim Ross, Larry Merchant, Jesse Ventura, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Gorilla Monsoon. A commentary can mean comments, spoken or written, which help people understand a book, Play (theatre) or work of art.
Commercial aviation	Commercial aviation is the part of civil aviation (both general aviation and airline) that involves working aircraft for hire to transport passengers or multiple loads of cargo. The Air Commerce Act of 1926 began to allow commercial aviation by creating standards, facilitation, and promotion.
Commitment scheme	In cryptography, a commitment scheme is a way for a someone to tell something to someone without letting other people know. Someone would do this to make sure they can prove who they are. Someone also might do this to make sure that someone does not cheat. This is done by using a one-way function to change a String (computer science) into a Hash function. This is called the commit phase. Later, if someone needs to prove that they were the one who made the commitment, then they can tell people the original string they used. This is called the reveal phase.
Common Language Specification	A Common Language Specification (CLS) is a document that says how computer programs can be turned into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code. When several languages use the same bytecode, different parts of a program can be written in different languages. Microsoft uses a Common Language Specification for their .NET Framework. To fully interact with other objects regardless of the language they were used in, objects must expose to callers only those features that are common to all the languages they must exchange information with. It was always a dream of Microsoft to unite all different languages into one umbrella and CLS is one step towards that. Microsoft has defined CLS which are nothing but guidelines for languages to follow so that it can communicate with other .NET languages in a seamless manner. Most of the members defined by types in the .NET Framework class library are able to work with CLS. However, some types in the class library have one or more members that are not able to work with CLS. These members allow support for language features that are not in the CLS. The CLS was designed to be large enough to include the language constructs that are commonly needed by developers, yet small enough that most languages are able to support it. Any language construct that makes it impossible to quickly confirm the type safety of code was excluded from the CLS so that all languages that can work with CLS can produce code if they choose to do so. [[en:Common Language Specification]]
Common land	Common land (a common) is land where local people have certain rights. For example, to allow their sheep to , to collect firewood, or to cut turf for fuel. Originally in mediaeval England the common was part of the manor. Although it was part of the estate owned by the lord of the manor, tenants had certain rights. By extension, the term "commons" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to. Today the term "common" is mainly used for the land over which the rights are exercised. A person who has a right to common land is a commoner. Today commons still exist in Great Britain and the United States, although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed in the 17th century.
Common scold	In the criminal common law of England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public . The term was applied to a woman who caused and who disturbed the peace by Argument and fighting with her neighbours all the time. The Latin language name for this type of woman was communis rixatrix. This name's grammar only applies to females. This makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime. When British people first went to the North America, they took this crime with them. The crime was often Punishment by "ducking". Ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond. They were then lowered into the water, until they were all in the water. This was done several times. Few people were actually convicted of being a common scold, but it remained a crime listed on the law books of England and Wales until 1967. Because it applied only to women, it was eventually banned in the United States. This was because the U.S. Constitution (the highest law in the U.S.) does not allow people to be treated differently from each other. This comes from a section of the Constitution called the Equal Protection Clause.
Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems	Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems is a paper published by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory. It is one of the foundational treatments (primitives) of modern cryptography. It is also a proof that all Theory unbreakable (un-crack-able) ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad encryption algorithm. Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the Classified information report A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography, Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories. In 1948, Shannon published his great paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory.
Community (ecology)	In ecology, a community is all the living things in a place. It may mean a group of living things that are not dependent on other communities. It may mean a small group, such as the living things in a piece of dead wood. Population without double counting of many species make up a community when joined together. A community with its physical and chemical environment makes an ecosystem. Each population can have an effect on other populations in the community in different ways, which are called symbiosis. In consumption, one living thing eats another. Three kinds of consumption are predation, herbivory, and parasitism. In predation, one animal, the predator, kills and eats another animal, the prey. In herbivory, an animal called an herbivore eats a plant, either in part or in whole. In parasitism, a parasite lives on another living thing, the Host (biology). The parasite eats small parts of tissue or nutrients from the host, but usually does not kill it. In Competition (biology), two living things, from the same or different species, both need the same . If one species is better at getting the resources, the population of the other species may die out. Competition may have a negative effect on both species. In mutualism, two species both help each other, so they have a positive effect on each other. In commensalism, one species is helped, but it has no effect on the other species.
Community Identification Number	The Official Municipality Key, which used to be called the Official Municipality Characteristic Number or Municipality Code Number, is a group of numbers used to tell the difference between different municipality and areas.
Companhia de Electricidade de Macau	Companhia de Electricidade de Macau (CEM; ; English language: Macau Electricity Company) is an electricity company in Macau, People's Republic of China. Its main business is Electricity generation, Electric power transmission, Electric power distribution and electricity selling in Macau.
Companion planting	In gardening and farming, companion planting is the of different crops next to each other. It is done to help the crops grow and to use the Space (physics) available as much as possible. Depending on the crops chosen, companion planting may encourage processes that help the plants, such as pollination. Some companion plants may help Pest control, such as caterpillars or fungi, from damaging the crop. Some of these, called trap crops attract pests away from the crop. Other plants may serve as for the crops. Many of the basic principles of companion planting were used thousands of years ago in Mesoamerica. From about 8,000 years ago, Native American peoples grew Squash (plant), maize and Phaseolus vulgaris together. The stalk of the corn were there for the beans to climb, and the beans Nitrogen fixation, helping the maize.
Compensation (psychology)	In psychology, compensation is a way people hide something that they cannot do well, by doing something else really well. They may not even be aware that they are doing it. Compensation can hide real or imagined problems and personal or physical inferiority. However it does not really solve the cause of the problem. Positive compensations may help a person overcome difficulties. But negative compensations do not, and can even make the problems worse. There are two kinds of negative compensation:
Competition (biology)	Competition is an between Organism or species in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. According to evolution, this competition within and between species for resources plays a role in natural selection. Competition occurs when organisms or species need or use the same resources. Common resources are food, water and territory. Two species in competition often continue long-term in the same environment. This suggests they each have an "edge" which the other does not. In may cases being there first is a big edge. For example, plants consume nitrogen by absorbing it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Species in competition may directly interfere with each other. An example of this can be seen between the ant Novomessor cockerelli and red harvester ants, where the first interferes with the ability of the second to forage. It does this by plugging the entrances to their rival's Colony (biology) with small rocks.
Compiler	A compiler is a computer program that translation computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. The first language is called the source language, and the code is called source code. The second language is called the target and can usually be understood by computers. In that case, the instructions become machine code. If a compiler can convert the same instruction text into machine code for different computers (like smartphones or video game machines), it is a 'cross-compiler'. If the compiler can make instruction text that is easier for people to read, it is a 'de-compiler'. People who write these instructions are called programmers. Some even made programs that can translate the instructions that describe how a compiler should work, into a compiler. That kind of program is called a compiler-compiler. A compiler usually has three steps. It reads the text and makes notes about how the instructions go together. If the instructions don't make sense, it will try to tell the programmer. Then it will use what it knows about the target language to make the instructions fit better. It then writes down the instructions in the target language. If the source instructions are on different pages, it may have to compile several before it can write everything down.
Complaint	In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that es the facts and legal reasons for a lawsuit. A complaint must list the reasons for the plaintiff's legal case, and it must ask for a specific legal remedy. Once a complaint is filed with the court a summons (an order from the court) is notifies the defendant a lawsuit has been filed against them. Once a defendant receives notice of a complaint, they must reply within a specified period of time with an answer. Usually this requires the help of an attorney.<ref name=LC/> In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be started by the filing of a complaint. This is also called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. All criminal cases are Prosecutor in the name of the Authority. This is the same authority whose criminal laws were broken and who enforces Criminal law. The government is sometimes called the state, the People or the Crown (in Commonwealth realms). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most US jurisdictions, the document presented to and authorized by a grand jury is called an indictment.
Composers Union of Azerbaijan	The Composers Union of Azerbaijan () is a non-governmental organization that unites and officially represents professional Composer and Musicology in Azerbaijan. The union was established in 1934.
Composition (visual arts)	In visual arts, the composition is the way that colors or shapes are put together or arranged in a particular painting, graphic, Photography or sculpture.
Compost	Compost is a type of fertilizer that is made from plants. It is easy and cheap to make, as all it really requires is vegetable waste. The vegetable waste is broken down by bacteria (germs), and made into compost.
Computer Algebra System	A computer algebra system (CAS) is a large computer program that helps people with mathematics and algebra. It changes and moves around (manipulates) mathematical equations and expressions containing numbers and symbols called variables. Variables can stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for, or can be replaced with any value. It always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression, unless it is being transformed, by a transformation algorithm. A CAS might be used for integral or derivative (mathematics) (and other calculus transformations), simplification of an expression (making it smaller and/or simpler), optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables, etc. Most have the ability to Cartesian coordinate system for visualization, which can be helpful and educational too.
Computer law	Many countries have created or have passed laws about the use of computers and data (computing). These laws are usually concerned
Computer program	A computer program is a list of instruction (computer science) that tell a Computer science what to do. Everything a computer does is done by using a computer program. Programs stored in the memory of a computer ("internal programming") let the computer do one thing after another, even with breaks in between. John von Neumann, a mathematician born in Hungary, came up with this idea in the late 1940s. The first digital computer designed with internal programming capacity was the EDVAC (which means Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer), built in 1949. Some examples of computer programs:
Concentric	Concentric objects share the same center, axis, or origin. Circles,spheres, cylinders, tubes, and other round objects can be concentric. Concentric shapes do not normally have the same radius.
Concept	A concept is an idea that is applied to all objects in a group. It is the way people see and understand something. The name used to identify a concept (the concept's label) is a "term". For example, the word "Dog" is the term to identify the concept of what a dog is. Everything that a person knows about a dog is the concept of the term dog. Different terms can be used to identify the same concept. Car and Automobile are synonyms for the same concept. Different languages have different terms for the same concept. This is what makes translation possible. The terms may be different in each language, but the concept is the same. The concept of jumping is the same to a person from England and a person from Italy, but one person uses the term "Jump" to mean the concept and the other person uses "Salto".
Concurring opinion	In law, a concurring opinion is a written opinion by one or more judges of a court which agrees with the decision made by the Majority opinion, but states different (or additional) reasons for the decision. It may also be used to add comments.<ref name=USLegal/> When no absolute majority of the court can agree on the basis for deciding the case, the decision of the court may be contained in a number of concurring opinions. The concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is called the plurality opinion. Having failed to receive a majority of the court's votes, concurring opinions are not Precedent (common law) and cannot be cited as such. But concurring opinions can sometimes be cited as a form of precedent (assuming there is no binding precedent already in effect). The conflict in views between a majority opinion and a concurring opinion can assist a lawyer in understanding the points of law in the majority opinion. Occasionally, a judge will use a concurring opinion to signal that he or she is open to certain types of "test case (law)s" that would allow the development of a new legal rule. In turn, such a concurring opinion may become more famous than the majority opinion in the same case. A well-known example of this phenomenon is Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. (1944).
Conducting	Conducting in music means beating Time signature to help a group of musicians to sing or play well together. If an orchestra is playing music, it is important that they all play exactly together. They need to know exactly when to start, what tempo (speed) to go, how Dynamics (music) to play, and what the mood of the music should be. If a small number of people play music together (like in a chamber orchestra), they can talk about this amongst themselves. One person can nod with his/her head or with the Bow (music) of a string instrument to help the group to start and finish together. With larger orchestras, such as a symphony orchestra, there are so many people (almost a hundred of them in some cases) that they need a separate person to lead. This person is called the conductor.
Conflict of interest	Conflict of interest is a situation when personal goals may affect the persons’ ability to do their job fairly and in a professional way.
Confusion and diffusion	In cryptography, confusion and diffusion are two properties of the operation of a secure cipher. Confusion and diffusion were identified by Claude Shannon in his paper, "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" published in 1949. In Shannon's original definitions:
Congruence	In geometry, two figures or objects F and F' are congruent (written as F \cong F') if they have the same shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other. More formally, two sets of point (geometry) are called congruent, if and only if one can be transformed into the other by isometry. For isometry, rigid motions are used. This means that two geometrical figures are congruent if one object can be repositioned, rotated or reflected—but not resized—so that it coincides exactly with the other object. if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is, then the two figures are congruent. If one of the object has to change its size, then the two objects are not congruent: they are just called Similarity. As an example, two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely (turning the paper over here is permitted). Congruent polygons are polygons that if you fold a regular polygon in half that is a congruent polygon.
Conservation (art)	Conservation, also known as conservation and restoration or simply conservation, is a job where people try to protect the important parts of a culture for the future. Conservation activities include examination, documentation, treatment, protection. All of this work is supported by research and education.
Consonant mutation	Consonant mutation is a feature in Language when the sound of a consonant changes depending on Morphology (linguistics) and syntax.
Consortium	A consortium (which may also be called syndicate) is formed by two or more independent companies, individuals, or other economic actors that work together for a limited amount of time, usually to fulfill a purpose. Consortia are common in the building industries, roads and bridges are often built by consortia.
Conspiracy (criminal)	Under criminal law, conspiracy is agreeing between two or more people to commit a crime sometime in the future. Examples of conspiracy include conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to kidnapping or conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy law usually does not need proof of specific intent by defendants to hurt any specific person to establish an illegal agreement. Conspirators could be guilty even if they do not know the identity of the other conspiracy members. Conspiracy against the United States is a federal crime in the United States.
Constitutional economics	Constitutional economics is a program of joint study of economics and constitutionalism. It is often described as "the economic analysis of constitutional law." Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of constitutional rules "limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies." This is different from the approach of traditional economics. Also, constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens." For example, proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation. Constitutional economics tries bringing together constitutional economic, social and cultural rights of the citizens and economic policy of the state.
Constitutional law	Constitutional law is an area of law that shows how the institutions of a country are organised, and the basic rights rights of citizens. In most countries, such as the Constitution of the United States, this is found in a written text called a constitution. Some countries use a lot of different texts and unwritten rules instead, such as the Constitution of the United Kingdom.
Constructivism	Constructivism was an artistic and architecture movement that originated in Russia from 1913 by Vladimir Tatlin onward which rejected the idea of art for art's sake in favour of art for social purposes. It heavily influenced graphic and industrial designers. Constructivism as an active force lasted until around 1934, having a great deal of effect on the art of the Weimar Republic and elsewhere, before being replaced by Socialist Realism. Its motifs have sporadically recurred in other art movements since. <gallery>|Spatial Construction #12: plywood, open construction partially painted with aluminum paint, and wire, by Alexander Rodchenko, 1920.File:Naum Gabo Fountain.jpg|Sculpture/fountain by Naum Gabo at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, LondonFile:Rotterdam kunstwerk gestileerde bloem detail1.jpg|Naum Gabo sculpture, Rotterdam</gallery>
Consumer price index	The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a way of measuring the overall price level of the Goods and Services marketing in the economy.
Consumer protection	Consumer protection means protecting the rights of consumers. It also helps to protect fair trade Competition (economics) and truthful information in a market economy. Various laws and organisations are designed to do this. The laws are designed to stop Company using unfair practices to gain an advantage over their competitors. Examples of such practices are fraud and "false advertising", where a company advertising their product with false information. Consumer protection laws are a form of regulation.
Consummation of marriage	The first time married people have sexual intercourse with each other, after their marriage is called consummation. One of the reasons why people get married is to have Child. Many countries (and jurisdictions) have laws so that people who do not have sex with each other can have their marriage annulled (undone).
Contactor	A contactor is an electric device to switch an electric circuit. It is controlled electrically for it to switch on or switch off the circuit. It has a relatively high electric current rating. The control circuit usually has much lower Electric power level than the switched circuit.
Contemporary architecture	Contemporary architecture is generally speaking the architecture being made at the present time. The term contemporary architecture is also applied to a range of styles of recently built structures and spaces (broadly speaking - since the 1980s) which are Optimization for Utility.
Contempt of court	Contempt of court, often known as "contempt", is the offense of being disobedient to or disrespectful toward a court of law and its officers.
Content Scramble System	The Content Scrambling System (or Content Scramble System) is a system to encryption and copy-protect DVDs. Such systems are generally called Digital Rights Management (or DRM) systems. CSS uses symmetric cryptography. It was introduced in 1996; today, it is considered ineffective. In October 1999, Jon Lech Johansen and two other people (who remained anonymous) broke the system. CSS uses 40-bit cryptographic keys; because of different design problems, the effective key length is only about 16 bits. A 450 MHz processor, current at the time could Brute force attack this in less than a minute. A modern processor such as the Intel Core i7 or Athlon 64 can crack it in a few seconds. CSS requires special information in the lead-in (a special area) of the disc. Since the lead-in cannot be changed on recordable DVDs these cannot have CSS protection (with a few exceptions, some professional drives allow writing CSS keys to recordable discs).
Contract	A contract is an agreement or promise that the law can enforce. The law will enforce some agreements but not others. For example, in most places, if a parent promises to take a child to get ice cream, the law will not enforce that promise as a legal contract. The legal rules about which promises are enforced by the law can be different in different places (or jurisdictions), but a contract is usually enforced only if it is made by people or groups who want it to be enforced and who know what they are doing. Sometimes, a contract is writing down and signature by the agreeing to it, but it does not always need to be. People usually sign a contract when something important or costly is being done. For example, when people take a job, they will sometimes sign a contract with their employers. The contract will show what the person must do as part of his job, how much they will be paid, and so on. The person and the employer will sign the contract, and it will become a law promise. If someone breaks a contract, another person might lawsuit him or her. In a lawsuit about a contract, the court will look at the contract, listen to what the people who made the contract say about it, and then make a decision about what the contract means.
Contrail	A contrail (condensation trail) is a cloud-like trail of water vapor or ice crystals left by an airplane. When jet fuel burns, it produces water vapor and carbon dioxide. The water vapor condenses (turns from gas to liquid) because of the low temperature at the high altitude that the plane is flying. The chemtrail conspiracy theory claims that these trails may contain harmful chemicals being sprayed by government organizations.
Contribution claim	A contribution claim is a claim made by one or more people in a court case to get money from a person not involved in the case. In most cases, contribution claims are made like the original claim itself. The claim must be personally given to the new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution relief). In contrast, a counter-claim asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury. Finally, a cross-claim is the same as a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants. Counter-claims and cross claims do not require personal service because no new parties are being added to the claim. In some state court systems, a contribution claim must be made as a new case, and the person making it must pay a fee. In other states, no extra fee is required.
Controlled burn	A controlled burn (sometimes also called a prescribed fire) is a fire that is started on purpose, and kept under control. It is done by people who are trained in controlling a fire, with the right equipment and the right weather conditions. It is done to help the environment or to make an area safer for people. This is not the same as a practice fire, where a firefighter crew might start a fire in a house or other building that is going to be destroyed. They use it for practice, to learn how to enter a burning house safely and how to put out a house fire. Controlled burns, on the other hand, are done outdoors in forests or prairies.
Convex set	In Euclidean geometry, a is a convex set if the following is true. For any two points inside the region, a straight line can be drawn. If every point on that segment is inside the region, then the region is convex. The point is that a convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set. So, any shape which is concave, or has a hollow, cannot be a convex set.
Copaganda	Copaganda is when the media show police officers in a good way, and do not show the bad actions that they do. The word is a portmanteau of cop and propaganda, and is used by Black Lives Matter activists. Showing police in a good way is not thought to be true for many working class, indigenous, Brown people, and Black people people. Since the George Floyd protests, the term has been used more to criticize the media.
Corbel	In architecture a corbel or console is a structure piece of stone, wood or metal sticking out from a wall to carry a weight. It is a type of . The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times. The word "corbel" comes from Old French and derives from the Latin corbellus, a diminutive of corvus (a raven) which refers to the beak-like appearance. Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a corbeau (a crow).
Corium	Corium (also called fuel containing material (FCM) or lava-like fuel containing material (LFCM)) is a lava-like fuel containing nuclear fuel, fission products, control rods, structural materials from the affected parts of the reactor, products of their chemical reaction with air, water and steam, and, in the event that the reactor vessel is breached, molten concrete from the floor of the reactor room. It is created in a nuclear reactor's Nuclear reactor core while a nuclear meltdown occurs. Nuclear fuel, fission products, and control rods are what consists of Corium.
Coronagraph	A coronagraph is a telescope to see things around the Sun. The telescope uses a disk to block the bright surface of the sun, exposing bright objects around the sun to be visible to human eyes.
Corporal punishment	Corporal punishment (also called physical punishment) is a punishment which is meant to cause physical pain on a person. It is most often performed on minor (law) (in other words: children and teenagers). Common methods include spanking, belting and paddling. It has also been used on some adults, mostly on prisoners and slavery. In some parts of the United States, corporal punishment is allowed in schools. At home, corporal punishment is allowed. Fifty-eight countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, have banned corporal punishment in the home or at school. Corporal punishment has been shown to cause aggression and behavior problems in some teenagers and children.
Cortana	Cortana is a virtual helper. Microsoft made Cortana and released it on April 2, 2014 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Cortana can do many things. For example, it cna use Bing search. Cortana was released three years after Siri, which was released in 2011 on IOS.
Costume	A costume is a set of Clothing that someone wears to look different from what they normally wear. Some costumes are special to country or regions. Some people wear them because they are proud of their country. Actors in theatre wear costumes because they are to be a person in a Play (theatre) or ballet. Costumes can also be worn for carnivals or party.
Coulomb's law	Coulomb's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion.
Counselor	A counselor is a trained professional who helps others by listening to them and giving them . They may be a psychologist or a social work. Counselors help people with things like career development, anger management, health and lifestyle. Schools often have counselors to help students there.
Counterpoint	Counterpoint is the art of Composition (music) music by combining different part (music) in a way that sounds nice. Music composed like this is called contrapuntal. If the tune of Twinkle, twinkle little star is played on the piano and then some chords are added, this is harmony, not counterpoint. Instead, if the tune of Twinkle, twinkle little star was played while another melody was played, this would be considered counterpoint. A different way of playing it would be to start the tune with the right hand. Then, in the second bar (music) (measure), as the fifth note is played, the left hand starts to play the tune an octave lower. This works well for a time, but in the fifth bar (on the word “Up” in the right hand part) it starts to get dissonant (sounding unpleasant), so changes need to made to the left hand to make it sound nicer. This way of writing with a particular number of parts (in this case: two) is called "contrapuntal music". In that example the left hand imitated the right hand at first. This is called imitation. If the second part had continued to imitate all the way through the piece it would have been a canon (music). But “Twinkle, twinkle” does not work well as a canon. One famous canon is by Thomas Tallis. A canon that can be repeated is called a Round_(music) . This is all contrapuntal music. Counterpoint does not have to have imitation, although it often does. The important thing is that each part (i.e. each voice) is equally important. It is not one part singing the tune and the rest just accompanying. Counterpoint does not have to be one note against one note. There can be two or more notes in one part against one in the other e.g. crotchets (quarter notes) in one part and quavers (eighth notes) in another. There is a whole system for this called “species”. Counterpoint can be varied by inverting it, i.e. putting the top part at the bottom. When music is written so that the parts can be swapped round it is called "invertible counterpoint". The word “counterpoint” comes from the Latin “punctus contra punctum” meaning “point against point”. The word “point” meant “note”. Several hundred years ago composers found how to write contrapuntal music. They often took a main tune (called a “Cantus Firmus”) and then added one or two or more parts to it. The more parts there were the harder it was to compose because it all had to fit so that it sounded good. Music for several voices written in this way is called polyphonic music. Polyphony was used in all church music in the Renaissance. The greatest composer of polyphony was Giovanni da Palestrina (1525-1594). Students learning the art of composition today still learn counterpoint by taking Palestrina’s music as their model.
Country code	Country codes are in mostly times created by few letters or numbers that represent geography codes (geocodes) of country that use certain country code, it is in use in data processing and communications. There are few different systems created for this. The most known is ISO 3166-1. The term country code in many times refers to international dialing codes, the E.164 list of country calling codes.
Court order	A court order (or order) is a formal Writing direction by a member of the judiciary. It directs a party to do something. It can also be an order not to do something, as in an injunction. An order can be as simple as setting a date for trial (law). They can also be [[Wikt:complex|complex]] involving many details. It may be a final order (one that concludes the court action), or an [[Wikt:interim|interim]] order (one during the action). Most orders are written, and are signed by the judge. Some orders, however, are spoken orally by the judge in open court, and are only reduced to writing in the Transcript (law) of the proceedings.
Crackme	A crackme is a small program designed to test a programmers reverse engineering skills. It is also known by the terms reversemes and keygenmes. They are created to have a legal way to "crack" software.
Crayola	Crayola is an American brand of crayons and other writing and drawing utensils, such as markers, chalk and colored pencils. The company used to be called "Binney & Smith Company". It is based in Northampton, Massachusetts. Since 1984, it has been owned by the company Hallmark Cards.
Crayon	Crayons are writing tools made with colored wax, water, and citric acid or chalk. Young children often use them to draw. Some adult artists use them too. They melt at a low temperature so they can be used in crayon-drip art. One very well-known Trademark of crayons is Crayola, a company by Binney and Smith. [[category:Writing tools]]
Creating	Creating is making new things that have not existed before, usually by combining two or three things that existed. Art is almost always called creative, but so are other activities like music, mathematics, technology, business, craft, building, gardening and forestry, if they combine things to get new things. When several people cooperate in more than one of creating, that is a creative network. This cuts risk since anything creative involves some chance that it will simply not work. What is "not creative" is usually called imitative, and includes anything that is mostly trying not to do what has never been done – like law, sports, science, war and especially education. These involve more direct competition, so risk comes from the competitor who may do it better. The word team is used for such groups. Most people fear change and new things, and so what is most stable and considered important by society tends to be imitative and done in teams. But unless society encourages creating it loses out to others by competition in business or technology, so there must be some creative networks, somewhere, in labs or art studios. Views of control of creative work also depend very much on religious and spiritual views of nature (or a creator) creating Man, according to economist Lester Thurow. Those ethical traditions that see "Man in the image of God" have created legal codes (see guild, intellectual right, intellectual interest, intellectual property) to tightly control what they are creating or have created. These are now the basis of organizations such as WIPO or ICANN. Often, such laws also create control over things which are merely found, not created. Many people give away what they have created and never think about it as property – other people try to control it and get paid every time anyone sees it – or even every time they just talk about it. Wikipedia uses the GNU FDL which is a content license that tries to get people to combine what they are creating, with no one clearly in control. This is considered strange by many people, who are uncomfortable with that idea, or seek to control some aspect of it themselves.
Creative writing	Creative writing is a type of writing that involves writing in an artistic way. Creative writing usually follows the rules of formal writing, except it may not follow the rules of formal writing to achieve effect in the writing. Within schools, creative writing typically has a focus on writing in an original style, using original ideas and writing.
Credit Suisse	Credit Suisse Group is a Switzerland bank. It is headquartered in Zurich. The company was founded in 1856 as Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, ) jointly by Alfred Escher and the German bank [[:de:Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt|Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt]] which held 50% of the equity.
Credo Reference	Credo Reference is a company that offers subscription-based online reference content. It provides full-text online versions of more than 700 published reference works from over 70 publishers, including general and subject dictionary and encyclopedias.
Creepypasta	Creepypastas are Horror and terror-related legends or images that have been copied and pasted around the Internet. These Internet stories are often short, user-generated, ghost stories meant to scare readers. They include gruesome tales of murder, suicide, and otherworldly occurrences. According to Time (magazine) magazine, the genre had its peak audience in 2010 when it was covered by The New York Times.<ref name="Time"/> Famous creepypastas include Slender Man, "Jeff the Killer", Candle Cove and "Ted the Caver". After a 12-year old committed Slender Man stabbings in the name of Slender Man, some creppypaster administrators told their viewers that these stories have a fine line between reality and fiction.<ref name="Time"/>
Crew	A crew usually is a group of people that work within a common organisation, and that have some activities in common. The usual place where crews can be found are ships and airplanes. On such ships and aircraft, some functions some people perform are very special. It is therefore common that crews are organised in a hierarchy. Every person, except the captain, at the top, has a person above them. They will report to that person.Teams who work backstage in theaters, on movie sets, and in television studios are also called crews. Such crews are distinct from the Cast member.
Criminal law	Criminal law is the part of law that is about social norms. People who violate these norms are Punishment for their violation. It is different from civil law. Criminal law wants to protect certain values, such as life and limb, or property. Criminal law has different objectives:
Criminal procedure	Criminal procedure refers to the rules that determine how the courts will process a criminal trial. While criminal procedure differs by jurisdiction, the process generally begins with a formal criminal charge and results in the [[Wikt:conviction|conviction]] or of the defendant.
Crop	Crops are living plants grown by farmers. Most crops are foods such as grain, vegetables, or fruit. Some crops are for drugs, such as quinine, or fibers such as cotton, or other materials such as rubber or wood. Farms are usually made to grow just one kind of crop. Crops are domestication, most of which have been artificial selection to improve their size, taste and other qualities. Many crops are farmed in monoculture.Growingng crops is a part of agriculture.
Crop protection	Crop protection is a branch of horticulture, aimed at protecting crops. This is done so that the yield of the crop does not diminish. Common approaches are:
Crop rotation	Crop rotation is a practice used in farming. It involves the planting of different seeds on the same land in different years or seasons, using a set pattern. This technique helps replace the nutrients in the soil for the plants. It also reduces plant-specific pests on the land.
Cross section (geometry)	A cross section is what one gets if one cuts an object into slices. In geometry the correct definition of cross section is: the intersection of a Physical body in 2-dimensional Space (physics) with a line, or of a body in 3-dimensional space with a Plane (mathematics). A cross section, or section is also an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object. A floor plan is a section viewed from the top.
Cross-platform	Cross-platform software is a type of software that can run on many different operating systems or computer architectures. Together, the combination of an operating system and computer architecture is commonly referred to as a platform (computing). Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, BlackBerry, Linux and Android (operating system) are five different types of well-known platforms. Cross-Platform Development is very crucial towards marketing business over different platforms. Nowadays, there are multiple platforms for the customer base to surf the internet. A website has a particular pixel and differs in height and width that may not locate the different screen sizes. With the help of cross-platform development, a developer creates the website to mold to any screen size. Developing an application for multiple platforms is very complex, as it needs high-tech backend work to make the app run on different platforms. With the wide range of OS, mainly iOS and Android, the application needs to be developed. However, with a cross-platform, both iOS and Android can install and run the application. It means the business is targeting the world market for enhanced revenues.
CrossOver	CrossOver is the collective name for four commercial programs developed by CodeWeavers that allow using Microsoft Windows programs on Mac OS X and Linux.The programs include "CrossOver Linux", "CrossOver Mac", "CrossOver Games" and "CrossOver Games Linux". They are modified versions of the Free software and open source Wine compatibility layer.
Cryovolcano	A cyrovolcano (also called an "ice volcano") is a type of volcano. It erupts volatiles such as water, ammonia, or methane, instead of molten rock. Cryovolcanoes are found on icy moon and might be on other places with low temperatures, like Kuiper belt objects. Cryovolcanoes have been found on the moons Triton and Enceladus.
Crypsis	Crypsis is a word in ecology which means "hiding". It refers to the ways animals avoid being seen, or otherwise detected. It also includes the situation when an animal is noticed, but is not recognised for what it is. It may be either a defence against predators, or a device for predators to get near prey. Methods include camouflage, nocturnality (night-time activity), [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] lifestyle, transparency, and Batesian mimicry. The word can also be used about egg (biology), and about pheromone production. Crypsis can in principle involve visual, olfactory or auditory system camouflage.
Cryptographic hash function	A cryptography hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The string is called the 'hash value', 'message digest', 'digital fingerprint', 'digest' or 'checksum'. The ideal hash function has three main properties:
Cryptographic protocol	A cryptographic protocol (also known as encryption protocol or security protocol) is an abstract or an existing protocol (computing) that performs a information security-related function and applies cryptography methods. A protocol describes how the cryptography algorithms should be used to information security. The description of a protocol must include details about all data structures and representations, and all details about how to utilize the protocol by computer program. Cryptographic protocols are widely used for Security application-level Data transmission, in order to Security transferred messages. A cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features:
Cryptography	Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and Research of hiding information. It is sometimes called code, but this is not really a correct name. It is the science used to try to keep information secret and safe. Modern cryptography is a mix of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Cryptography is used in automated teller machine, password, and electronic commerce. When a message is sent using cryptography, it is changed (or encryption) before it is sent. The method of changing text is called a "code" or, more precisely, a "cipher". The changed text is called "ciphertext". The change makes the message hard to read. Someone who wants to read it must change it back (or decryption it). How to change it back is a secret. Both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it, but other people should not be able to. Studying the cyphertext to discover the secret is called "cryptanalysis" or "cracking" or sometimes "code breaking". Different types of cryptography can be easier or harder to use and can hide the secret message better or worse. Ciphers use a "Key (cryptography)" which is a secret that hides the secret messages. The cryptographic method needn't be secret. Various people can use the same method but different keys, so they cannot read each other's messages. Since the Caesar cipher has only as many keys as the number of letters in the alphabet, it is easily cracked by trying all the keys. Ciphers that allow billions of keys are cracked by more complex methods. Since the time of Caesar, many improved cyphers have been made. Some involved clever mathematics to resist clever cryptanalysis. During the 20th century computers became the principle tool of cryptography.
Cryptosystem	There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem.
Crystal	A crystal is a solid whose atoms (or molecules) are arranged in a repeating pattern. Crystals are made from fluids by Crystallization, which is a kind of phase change. Usually the fluid is a liquid, but crystals can form from a gas too. For example, snow is water crystals (ice) formed from air that contains water vapor (evaporation water). Crystallization can be by freezing from a simple fluid or from a solution. Sometimes heat and pressure needs to be applied to a substance for crystals to form. Diamond is a carbon crystal formed under heat and pressure. Crystals are found naturally or can be made artificially. The surface of crystals often have regions that are flat, called facets. Facets occur naturally as crystals form, because flat layers of atoms are usually the most stable. The atoms in a facet are arranged in a regular pattern, such as the pattern of a chess board or a honeycomb. These facets reflect light to give crystals their shiny or sparky appearance. Artificial facets can be made in any shape by cutting or grinding a crystal, which is how some gemstones for jewelry are made. Different substances form different types of crystals. The study of the arrangement of atoms in crystals is crystallography. Well-known substances that form crystals are table salt (whose crystals are cubes), diamond, and quartz.
Crystallography	Crystallography is the study of the arrangement of atoms in solids that are mostly in three dimensional pattern. Before the development of X-ray crystallography, the study of crystals was based on their geometry. This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces, and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question.
Cuban art	Cuban art has been known since the 16th century. In the 16th century, painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe. They made decorations (including paintings and sculptures), in Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid-1700s, native-born artists were painting in Cuba, in the European tradition of painting. Many work of art were left behind by José Nicolás de la Escalera (d. 1804). For many of those works, there is proof that he was the one who painted those.<ref name = CA&NI/> Vicente Escobar (d. 1834) was a mestizo, and he did portraits that made his paintings popular with Cuba's elite (or people with wealth or political power). He opened [the first, or] one of the first painting workshop/studios in Cuba. He later graduation from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. Víctor Patricio de Landaluze (d. 1889) was a Spanish-born artist, and he was an early artist of the costumbrismo genre. He was opposed to Cuban independence, and that cost him some of his popularity with the public.<ref name = CA&NI/><ref name = CArt/>
Cuffs	Cuffs are a layer of fabric put at the wrists. It can either be separate or as a part of long Sleeve.
Cultured meat	Cultured meat, also called synthetic meat, is meat grown in cell culture instead of inside animals. It is a form of cellular agriculture. Cultured meat is produced using many of the same tissue engineering s used in regenerative medicine. Up to now the cost to produce cultured meat has been extremely high. The first cultured beef patty, created by Dr. Mark Post at Maastricht University, was eaten at a demonstration for the Mass media in London in August 2013.
Curfew	A curfew is an order which restricts people in their movements. It is very often an order which forbids people to be out on the streets after dark. Curfews may be made by governments in times of war or civil unrest. This is supposed to stop violence. Curfews may also be issued to young people. They are told that they have to be indoors after a certain time. The word "curfew" comes from the French language phrase "couvre-feu" which means "cover the fire". It was used to describe the time when all lamps and candles had to be blown out.
Current transformer	A current transformer (CT) is a transformer used to measure alternating current. CT is a part of instrument transformer. CT is used to measure current in a circuit when the current magnitude is too high to be measured safely. It is commonly used in power metering and power system protection.
Cursor	A cursor is a shape on a computer Computer monitor that shows where actions made with the Keyboard (computer) or mouse will make a change. There are 2 types of cursor that most people will use.
Curve	A curve is a line that s or s. A curved line is never straight, and a curved surface is a surface that is never flat. Some curves can be drawn on paper, but some curves, like a helix, can only be seen in 3-D. A circle is a curve that can be described with the formula x2 + y2 = r2. x and y are used as in a Cartesian coordinate system, and r is the radius of the circle (distance from the center to the outside). Many other curves can also be described with a formula like that.
Cutaway	A cutaway in movieing is a camera shot that interrupts the program. Its subjects are related. It is going on at the same time as the main action of the program.
Cyberstalking	Cyberstalking is when someone is using the Internet to stalking or harass someone. Cyberstalking is illegal in some countries.
Cypher	A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption (coding) or decryption (decoding). It is a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. To encipher or encode is to convert information from plain text into cipher or code. In non-technical usage, a 'cipher' often means the same thing as a 'code'; but in cryptography, ciphers are distinguished from codes. One 20th century source gives this explanation: a cipher is "a method in which the basic unit of concealment is the letter. In comparison, a code is a form of concealment in which the basic unit is the word". Late in the century, "codes" in this cryptographic sense became rare. 21st century cryptography mostly encrypts bitstreams. Codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase. For example, "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates". A cipher is used to turn the original information ("plaintext") to the encrypted form "ciphertext". The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but cannot be read by human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.To encipher or decipher, you need the "key (cryptography)". In encryption, a key specifies the particular transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, or vice versa during decryption. By type of key used ciphers are divided into:
D-Back	D-Back is the PC software designed by iMyFone Technology Co., Ltd. to help users recover lost or deleted data on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and fix iOS issues or iOS update/restore errors. It is available on both Windows and Mac systems including the free and paid versions. It supports features such as Smart Recovery, Recover from iOS Device, Recover from iTunes Backup, Recover from iCloud Backup, Fix iOS System etc.
DES-X	In cryptography, DES-X (or DESX) is an alternative to the Data Encryption Standard (Data Encryption Standard) block cipher designed to increase the complexity of a brute force attack using a technique called key whitening. As Data Encryption Standard suffers from brute force attack DES-X was a trial to overcome such drawbacks.
DMOZ	The Open Directory Project (ODP), also known as dmoz, is an online web directory that lists good web sites based on their subject. Web sites are listed in categories on this project. Each category is linked to relevant categories; the categories have a tree-like structure too.
DStv	DStv (Digital Satellite Television) is MultiChoice's digital satellite TV service in Sub-Saharan Africa, launched in 1995, providing various bouquets offering general entertainment, movies, lifestyle & culture, sport, documentaries, news & commerce, children, music, religion and consumer channels to MultiChoice subscribers. DStv has around 8 million subscribers, with the majority being in South Africa and Nigeria. These two markets are considered to be the most important markets for DStv, although markets such as Kenya, Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Mauritius and Tanzania, though not having as many subscribers, they are on major focus too.
Dadeumi	Dadeumi or Kinuta is a Korea, and Japan traditional ironing. The Washing Textile is placed on a stand in a dry state and beaten on it with a stick to smooth out wrinkles and soften.
Damages	In law, damages are an , usually of money. It is to be paid to a person as for loss or injury. The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the jurisdiction. Damages are not the same as court costs which includes the costs to bring a legal case to court. The losing party may also have to pay court costs.<ref name=FDF/>
Dansbandskampen	Dansbandskampen was a Swedish television show. It was created by Peter Settman and his production company Baluba. Peter Settman was also the show host. It was broadcasting over Sveriges Television, with season one airing October–December 2008. The show was a music competition with dansbands. There were talks of spreading the concept outside Sweden, with a disco/folk music version in Poland and a country music version in the USA.
Dark web	The bum is the World Wide bum content that exists on bumness. These are overlay bumworks which use the public internet but need specific bum software, configurations or authorization to access. The dark web is a small part of the deep web. The deep web is the part of the web not accessed by search engines. Sometimes the term "deep web" is wrongly used to refer to the dark web only. The dark web includes small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large networks like Freenet, I2P, and Tor (anonymity network). Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as the Clearnet (networking) because it is not encryption. The Tor dark web may be referred to as onionland,
Dark-sky preserve	A dark-sky preserve (DSP) is protected area without light pollution created by humans. These areas are used to help astronomy. Different countries have different programs for making areas dark-sky preserves. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) uses the word reserve instead of park, or preserve with their dark-sky preserves. This is so that people don't confuse International Dark Sky Reserves (IDSR) and International Dark Sky Parks (IDSP). In Canada, there is a very strict way to make areas dark-sky preserves. This was based on the work by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The program is based on the amount of light in an area and how much skyglow there is from cities and towns that are close to it. Canada's program is the only one in the world that makes areas dark-sky preserves. Outside Canada, when areas are called dark-sky preserves, they are not official, and might not be a real dark or protected preserve.
Data Base Task Group	The Data Base Task Group (DBTG) was a working group founded in 1965 by the Cobol Committee, formerly Programming Language Committee, of the Conference of Data Systems Language (CODASYL). In April 1971, The DBTG published a report containing specifications of a Data Manipulation Language (DML) and a Data Definition Language (DDL) for standardization of network database model. The first DBTG proposals had already been published in 1969. The specification was subsequently modified and developed in various committees and published by other reports in 1973 and 1978. The specification is often referred to as the DBTG database model or the CODASYL database model. As well as the data model, many basic concepts of database terminology were introduced by this group, notably the concepts of Database schema and subschema.
Data Encryption Standard	The Data Encryption Standard is a 56-bit cipher that was once recommended by the United States government. In 1998, it was defeated by a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It has been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard in most uses.
Dave (TV)	Dave is a British free to air television channel owned by the UKTV, which is available in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. The channel took the name Dave, in October 2007, between but it had been on air, under various identies and formats since October 1998. UK Gold Classics and UK Gold 2 take Fridays and Sundays from 6:00pm to 2:00am
Daxx	Daxx is a software company. It is headquartered in the Netherlands and has development offices in Ukraine. The main activity is focused on building dedicated software development teams. In December 2020, Daxx became part of Grid Dynamics (Nasdaq: GDYN). The General Manager is Igor Tkach.
De minimis	De minimis is a law term that means that small things do not matter in the law. The term is short for the Latin maxim (saying) de minimis non curat lex.
Death grunt	A death grunt is when a singer uses a screaming which is very low and deep. It is used in many types of music, but usually death metal. In many people's opinions, it is hard to understand the death grunt. However, some people who listen to them a lot think they are not so hard to understand. Some people believe that death grunts in music sound "scary", so they do not like them. Bands that use death growls include Necrophagist, Morbid Angel, Opeth, and many more.Bands that use higher screams that come from the throat include Escape the Fate, Alesana and Greeley Estates. Other terms for death grunts are death growls, harsh vocals, and unclean vocals.
Debugging	In computer science, debugging is the process of finding (and correcting) errors in a computer program. When programmers think that the program may have an error, they debug the program. They look for an error, and when they find it, they try to correct it so the program will work correctly. This improves the quality of the product.
Decadence	Decadence (pronounced: DEK-a-dence) means a state in which people are behaving in a way that is regarded by some people as being morally bad. The adjective is 'decadent'. It has nothing to do with the word decade (10 years).
Decision-making	Decision making is the mental process that leads to the selection of an action among several alternatives. Every decision making process produces a final choice. The output can be an action or an opinion. There is a growing awareness that people often make good decisions rapidly without knowing how they do it. This runs against the older rational decision-making ideas.
Declension	In linguistics, declension is the changing of the form of a word. This shows its function in the sentence, by way of some inflection. The inflectional change of verbs is called conjugation. Declensions may apply to nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and articles to indicate number (e.g. singular, dual, plural), case (grammar) (e.g. nominative case, accusative case, genitive case, dative case), gender (e.g. masculine, neuter, feminine), and a number of other grammatical categories. For example, in English, if there is more than one boy, the word must become boys. For example, "My family has two girls and one boy, but my wife's family has two girls and three boys". The form boy is singular, meaning there is only one of the noun, and the form boys is plural, meaning there is more than one of the noun. You must know the noun's singular form if you want to find it in an English dictionary. Also in English, a noun can change if it owns something. For example, if a toy belongs to one boy, the toy is the boy's toy, but if it belongs to two or more boys, it becomes the boys' toy. Both numbers of the noun have this Inflection, which is called the genitive case. Word case is when a word form changes depending on what part of the sentence it is.
Declination	Declination (abbrev. dec or δ) is a word used in astronomy to describe one of the two coordinates of the equatorial coordinate system, the other being either right ascension or hour angle. Dec is comparable to latitude, projected onto the celestial sphere, and is measured in degrees north and south of the celestial equator.
Decode Entertainment	Decode Entertainment was a Canadian production company, a distribution company and based in Toronto, Ontario. It was founded by Steven DeNure, Neil Court and John Delmage in 1997. On May 16, 2006, Decode and Halifax Film announced that they would merge the holding company DHX Media. Decode became a subsidiary company of DHX Media. The company was closed in the 2010s. In that same year, DHX Media ceased production on producing content at the "Ex-Decode" offices. DHX acquired Epitome Pictures in 2014, then they assumed the name of DHX Studios Toronto in 2016, but this company had no relation outside name.
Deconstruction	Deconstruction is a way of understanding how something was created, usually things like art, books, poems and other writing. Deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts. Deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object. The smaller parts are usually Idea. Sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean. It says that because words are not precise, we can never know what an author meant. Sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made Assumption. One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work. (It calls them "binary oppositions.") It says that two opposites like "good" and "bad" are not really different things. "Good" only makes sense when someone compares it to "bad," and "bad" only makes sense when someone compares it to "good." And so even when someone talks about "good," they are still talking about "bad." But this is just one thing it does. Because of things like this, deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first. Other meanings are always there too, and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together. The closer we look at the writing, the more we find about how it works, and how meaning works for all things. If we deconstructed everything, we might never be able to talk or write at all. But that does not mean deconstruction is useless. If we deconstruct some things, we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work.
Decriminalization	Decriminalization is making something legal that was illegal. For example, alcohol was illegal in USA during the 1920s. However, people felt strongly against it, and made it legal again.
Dedication	Dedication can mean: the act of consecration (making holy) a religious building such as a temple or church. Dedication can also mean the writing at the beginning of a book or piece of music in which the author or composer says that it was written for a particular person. For example: a composer may write a piece of music for a particular musician and dedicate it to them. An author may dedicate a book to someone they love or respect. A book or a piece of music may be dedicated to the person who has paid them to write it. This may be a rich person such as king.
Deep Web	The Deep Web is the part of the World Wide Web you can not search on common search engines such as Google. The part you can search is called the Surface Web. The first person who used the term "Deep Web" was Mike Bergman, a computer science, in the year 2000. Some people think that "darknet" and "Dark Web" are the same thing as Deep Web, but they are not. Let's explain what they mean:
Defence against herbivory	Defence against herbivory describes plant defences to avoid being eaten. There are many adaptations which improve the fitness of plants by reducing the effect of herbivores. Many plants produce chemicals which change the behaviour, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defences can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility. Some plants, known as hyperaccumulators, specialise in storing heavy metals which are toxic to animals. Some plants encourage the presence of predator of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. Some plants provide a home for ants which defend the plant strongly. Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place. They may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores. They may grow when herbivores are not around. Herbivores may get diverted towards non-essential parts, or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. Each type of defence can be either constitutive (always present in the plant), or induced (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores). Plants can and do react to damage. Historically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, especially the larvae of insects. The evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defences are directed against insects, other defences have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defences against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary viewpoint, but also because these defences can be used in agriculture, including human and livestock food sources.
Defence against predators	For most animals, defence against predators is vital. Being eaten is not the only threat to life: parasites and diseases may also be fatal. But animals, especially small animals, are often eaten. Since life is about reproduction, anything that keeps a creature alive long enough for it to reproduce will be natural selection for. The next generation comes from the Fertilisation eggs of the previous generation. Not surprisingly, then, animals have developed a wide range of defences against predation. Some of these defences apply also to plants: herbivore on plants can be very damaging, and reduce a plant's fertility. Many plants have some defence against herbivores.
Defense (legal)	In Civil laws and Criminal laws under the common law, a defendant may raise a defense (or defence) in an attempt to avoid criminal or civil legal liability. It is an answer, made by a defendant to a plaintiff's action or a denial of a prosecutor's charges. It is also an answer in equity (law).
Deficit spending	Deficit spending is when someone is spending more money than they have. In other words, it is when there is more spending than there is revenue. It is also called simply deficit, or budget deficit. The opposite of a deficit is a budget surplus. The term may be used for the budget of a government, private company, or person. Government deficit spending is a point of controversy in economics, with important economists having different views.
Degenerate art	Degenerate art () was the term used by the Nazi regime in Nazi Germany to describe nearly all modern art. The Nazis banned the art because they said it was un-Germany or was Jewish or Bolshevist in nature. Artists who were labeled as degenerate were punished by the laws. They were not allowed to teach, they could not show or sell their art, and some were even forbidden from creating any art at all. Degenerate Art was also used as the name for an exhibition put on by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The exhibition was made up of modern artworks, displayed badly, with text labels making fun of the art. This was meant to make people hate modernism. The show traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. While modern styles of art were not allowed, the Nazis liked paintings and sculptures that were very traditional and old fashioned. They thought art should glorify Nazi ideas of the "blood and soil" values of racial purity, militarism, and obedience. Music was also expected to be Tonality and free of any jazz influences; movies and plays were censorship. The censorship was done by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.
Demersal	Demersal animals live on or near the bottom of the ocean or lakes. The term is usually applied to fish. They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or Rock (geology).<ref name="seafloor" /> In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as Abyss depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere, which means to sink. Demersal fish are bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.
Demo (software)	A demo is a small portion or sample of a product. Usually the product is music, video game, or computer program. Demos are usually given to people who might be interested the product to try it before buying and advertising the product. [[da:Demo (computerspil)]]
Denial	Denial is a word used in psychology on defense mechanism. It means that someone denies that something has happened or is happening although he really knows it is true. Usually this happens because admitting it would cause a lot of pain. Denial is usually the first state of coping with loss. For example, if someone close to a person death, the survivor's first feeling might be denial, or refusal to accept the fact that the person is really dead. Denial, is also when you think that a team (like in football) will win a football match before its even started and refuse to accept the fact thet they could lose Denial, is also when you refuse to accept the fact that someone else did something (like change something) when you 'think you know' it was a different person
Denuvo	Denuvo Anti-Tamper is an Anti-tamper software and digital rights management software. It was developed by Austrian software company called Denuvo Software Solutions GmbH. Denuvo Software Solutions GmbH is a [[:wikt:en:subsidary|subsidary]] of Irdeto. The common name of Denuvo Anti-Tamper is Denuvo.
Deportation	Deportation, means the removal of someone from a country. People may be deported from a country for many reasons. For example, one may be deported from a country if he has got into the country illegally, or without a visa (permission). Deportation can also happen inside a country. A person or a group of people may be forced to move to a different part of the country, as a .
Depression (mood)	Depression is a state of low Mood (psychology) and not wanting to do anything. It can change what a person thinks, does, feels, and sense of well-being. It may lead to being sad, make it harder to think and a large change in and time spent sleeping. People who have depression may feel no hope and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. It can either be short term or long term. The main of depression is said to be anhedonia, which means losing of interest in things that usually make people happy. Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or dysthymia;<ref name="DSM-5(2013)"></ref> it is a normal to life events, such as losing a loved one; and it is also caused by some and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.
Derealization	Derealization (DR) is a change in the way someone views the world so that it seems unreal. Derealization can also make someone feel as if their environment does not have emotion or depth. This is a symptom of other problems, such as sleeping disorders, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. It can also be caused by drug intoxication. Similar to derealization is depersonalization, but the two are different. Depersonalization is a sense of unreality about oneself. Derealization is a sense of unreality of the outside world. Derealization often happens during a traumatic or tragic event.
Derivative (finance)	In finance, a derivative is a special type of contract. In it, the two parties agree to sell (or to buy) certain goods, at a given price, on a given date. Derivatives can be used in two ways. The first is called speculation: One party hopes that the market price differs from the price agreed upon in the contract, so that he can make the difference between the two. The second is called hedging: One party wants to make sure that the market price doesn't go in a direction that would hurt his profits, so he make sure that the price is agreed upon a long time before the transaction takes place. For a seller, hedging means that he can be certain to receive the agreed upon price, and for the buyer hedging means that he can be certain not to pay more than the agreed upon price. From a moral point of view, speculation is considered a negative activity. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century. Derivatives can take many forms but some of the most common types are Futures, Contracts for Difference and Options. They can also be structured on a range of different assets including Forex, Equities, Commodities and interest rates.
Derogation	Derogation (Latin derogatio) is the relaxation or exemption from of a rule of law. This is as opposed to a repeal or ending of a law. The term is used in both Civil law (legal system) and common law. It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean abrogation. For example in the legal maxim: Lex posterior derogat priori which means a more recent law may overrule an earlier law. Derogation is different from Dispensation (canon law) (an [[Wikt:exception|exception]] to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law. In terms of European Union legislation, a derogation can also Implication and inference that a member state delays putting into effect a part of an European Union Law (etc.) into their own legal system. This can be for a period of time such as five years. Or that a member state has decided not to enforce a specific provision in a treaty due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency).
Desert ecology	In deserts, there is very little vegetation. Depending on the type of desert, the climate may be very dry, or very hot. Desert ecology is about studying ecology in desert-like climates. Many of the organisms that live there have adaptation, to be able to cope with these conditions.
Desiccation	Desiccation is the state of extreme , or the process of extreme drying. A desiccant is a hygroscopic (water-attracting) substance that causes desiccation in a moderately sealed container.
Desktop environment	In graphical user interfaces and consoles a desktop environment is a location on a personal computer that helps the user get around on the computer. The desktop itself is a place in the operating system used for short cuts to computer files and folder (computing) on the hard drive. Computer icons (small pictures) are used to represent files/folders. Clicking these icons will open or start a folder or program. The desktop is the area where the start menu is if the computer has a start menu. Usually the desktop is the main screen on the computer. If no programs or folders are open, the computer will display the desktop. The most common desktop environment on personal computers is the one given by Microsoft Windows; another common environment is the one given by Apple Mac OS X. Other mostly-used desktop environments for UNIX-like Operating system using the X Window System are KDE, GNOME, Xfce. There are also other desktop environments, including : Aston shell, EDE, Graphical Environment Manager, IRIX Interactive Desktop, Sun Microsystems's Java Desktop System, Mezzo (desktop environment), Project Looking Glass, ROX Desktop, UDE, Xito, XFast.
Deterrence (legal)	In law, the term deterrence is used to describe the situation where punishment or threat is used to keep people from committing a crime. Both the person who committed a crime, as well as other people should be kept from committing that kind of crime.
Dharmaśāstra	Dharmaśāstra () is a genre of Sanskrit theological texts, and refers to the treatises (shastras) of Hinduism on dharma.
Diagonal	Diagonal is a kind of straight line. A diagonal line does not go straight up, down, or across. It is a line that connects two corners of a shape. In mathematics, "diagonal" has different meanings. For example, in geometry a diagonal is any line that goes between the corners of a polygon. So a square (geometry) has two diagonals, and a pentagon has five diagonals. In general the count of diagonal can be identified by a formula [n(n-3)]/2 where n is the total number of sides of shapes.
Dial-up	Dial-up internet access, usually just called Dial-up, is a slow way of connecting to the Internet by using a telephone line. A modem is connected between a computer and a telephone line and then the modem is instructed to dial the phone number of an Internet service provider (ISP) to connect to the Internet. The ISP must be a dial-up service provider with several dial-up modems waiting to accept dial-up calls. This kind of internet is slower than Digital subscriber line. In most parts of the world, dial-up service was the most common way of connecting to the internet in the late 20th century. Since the middle of the 2000s it has become uncommon, being largely replaced by DSL and cable modem where those are not too expensive.
Dialect	A dialect is a lect spoken by a group of people. Some people who live in the same place share a dialect. Some people who are similar in some other way, such as social class, share a dialect. There is no absolute difference between a dialect and a language. British English and American English are different standard dialects of English. They differ slightly in spelling, pronunciation, and vocabulary. However, they are "Mutual intelligibility", which means people who speak either variety understand the other. Deciding if something is a language or a dialect is sometimes a politics decision as a way to make minority group cultural assimilation or become part of a nation's larger culture. The linguistics Max Weinreich once joked that "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy."
Dialect continuum	A dialect continuum is a group of language dialects that change over an area. In a dialect continuum, two dialects are more different when they are farther away from each other. People in the dialect continuum who are nearby may understand each other when they speak. People far away from each other may have trouble understanding each other or may not understand each other at all. For exapmle if a certain area speaks in a specific accent, it would be difficult for people from the same region but different area to understand and communicate.
Diameter	In geometry, the diameter of a circle is a line from one side directly to the opposite side through the centre. It can also be defined as the longest chord of a circle. The same explanations can be also used to describe the diameter in a sphere. The letter d or the symbol ⌀ are often used as a symbol for the diameter. The diameter's length is often called the diameter itself. The diameter's length is twice the radius, and therefore the relationship between the diameter's length and radius can be shown with the equations: d = 2r and r = \frac
Diaper	A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing. It is worn by those who cannot control their urine or feces. Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again. They can also be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are very absorbent. Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. With the disposable you must constantly buy new ones. Viewed as unpleasant by some, diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has learned to use a toilet. They are also used by older people. There are adult diapers for people with medical problems. In the United Kingdom, Australia and several other countries, a diaper is called a nappy. Sometimes adults who do not have medical problems also wear diapers. This can be for different reasons. Sometimes it is because they have a profession where they cannot always get to a bathroom, like astronauts. Some adults wear diapers for fun. This is usually a form of sexual pleasure, or for emotional reasons. These people are often called "diaper-lovers" or "adult-babies." The scientific term for liking to wear diapers is "Diaper Fetishists."
Dick Figures	Dick Figures is an American adult comedy series created and written by Ed Skudder and Zack Keller. Episodes are shown on YouTube. The series is about two best friends named Red and Blue. They are stick figures. The series is rated MA. The first episode, "A Bee or Something", was shown on November 18, 2010. Episodes were uploaded every second week with ten episodes per season. There is currently, however, a big delay with season five as it is planned to be shown after the movie is released sometime in 2013.
Dictionary attack	A dictionary attack is a method used in cryptography to find a key (cryptography) (or username, or password). A large number of words are tried. These words usually come from a special collection, called a "dictionary". The attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. The listing is usually derived from a list of words, such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack).<ref>Jeff Atwood."Dictionary Attacks 101".</ref>
Diesel generator	A diesel generator is a diesel-electric system, a diesel engine that powers a electrical generator to Electricity generation. Diesel generators are located at places where there is no electricity supply from the electrical grid or for emergency supply if there is problem with the normal electricity supply. Diesel generator is often referred as generator set or genset for short, which is a combination of diesel generator with its supporting equipment, such as base, canopy, control system, sound attenuation, circuit breaker, starting system, exhaust system, diesel fuel supply etc.
Differential cryptanalysis	Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable to block ciphers, but also can be applied to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. It is the study of how differences in the input can affect the resultant differences at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques and methods for tracing differences through the network of transformations, discovering where the cipher demonstrates Random behaviour, and extend such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography). Differential cryptanalysis attacks are usually Chosen-plaintext attack, meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted Encryption for some set of plaintexts of his choosing.
Differential geometry	Differential geometry is a field of mathematics. It uses differential calculus and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geometry. The theory of the plane, as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study. Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century. In geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Carl Friedrich Gauß wondered whether triangle Bearing (navigation)s of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry. A long time ago, differential geometry was used for map projections. Today, it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory, or Satellite (artificial) navigation. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry.
Diffie-Hellman key exchange	The Diffie-Hellman key exchange (sometimes called an Exponential key exchange) is a protocol used to secretly share information with keys.
DigiCel FlipBook	DigiCel FlipBook is List of 2D animation software that runs on Microsoft Windows or MacOS. It is intended to closely recreate the traditional animation process, very similar to the likes of TVPaint and Toon Boom Harmony.
Digital Economy Act 2010	The Digital Economy Act 2010 is a law passed by the British government. It was introduced to prevent software piracy and to give Ofcom extra power to combat piracy. The law also deals with other things related to technology and television. Some people have said that the act was not examined well enough before it became law and should be changed to be more fair.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act	The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is a copyright law that protects copyright on the internet in the U.S.A. This Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1998. It puts into effect two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and distribution of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent (get around) measures which control access to copyrighted works. These "measures" are commonly known as digital rights management or DRM. The WIPO Copyright Treaty is the basis of protecting copyright on the web.
Digital signature	A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of Public-key cryptography. For messages sent through an insecure channel, a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is by panduthe one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender, and trust the message. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type. Digital signature are implemented using cryptography. Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret. Digital signatures are regularly used in USA, European countries and India in government as well as private offices. In India certificate called Digital Signing Certificate (DSC) is widely used for e-filing the business related documents and income tax return filing etc. Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. In some countries, including the United States, and in the European Union, electronic signatures may have legal significance. In India electronic signature do not have any legal significance but digital signature does have legal validity and considered as legally valid signature as per the information technology act, 2000.
Digital television	Digital television is television broadcasting using digital signals. With digital television, more than one Television programme can be sent at a time in the same channel Bandwidth (signal processing). It also provides a cleaner looking picture than analog. Digital television has replaced analog television in many countries. These countries include Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Digital television transition	The digital television transition (also called the digital switchover (DSO), the analog switch-off (ASO), the digital migration, or the analog shutdown) is when analog television signals are turned off so digital terrestrial television (DTT) can be used instead. This is done because it gives a better picture quality for viewers, lets more channels be broadcast in one area, and is cheaper to run. In some places, digital cable television, satellite television, or internet protocol television replaced analog television instead of DTT. This started happening in around 2000 when DTT began being used in many countries. It takes a long time to do, because older television sets could not receive DTT signals, and needed either a new television or a set-top box. During this time, broadcasters keep an analog signal broadcasting until enough people have switched to digital. Berlin was the first city to turn off all analog TV signals on 3 August 2003. Luxembourg was the first country to do this completely in September 2006.
Diglossia	Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use. One is the common language they use every day, and the other is either a much older version from centuries before (for example, Arabic language or Chinese language) or a similar but clearly different modern-day version (for example, Norwegian language with Bokmål and Nynorsk).
Dilation (geometry)	In geometry, dilation (also called homothety or homothetic transformation) is the process which changes the size of a figure without changing its shape, a type of transformation. Any figure and its image after dilation are Similarity (geometry) to each other. Dilation is defined by a point V, the center of dilation, and a number k, the ratio. Given a point P in the Plane (mathematics), its image P' (P prime) is on the line VP. The distance from P' to V is k times the distance from P to V.
Dimension	Dimensions are the way we see, measure and experience our world, by using up and down, right to left, back to front, hot and cold, how heavy and how long, as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics. One way to define a dimension is to look at the degree of freedom, or the way an object can move in a specific space. There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used, and there are also different definitions. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. In a vector space V (with Vector being "arrows" with directions), the dimension of V, also written as \dim(V), is equal to the cardinality (or number of vectors) of a Basis (linear algebra) of V (a set which indicates how many unique directions V actually has). It is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space. "Normal" objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions, which are usually called length, width and depth. Mathematicians call this concept Euclidean space. Dimensions can be used to measure position too. The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length, width and height directions. These distances are a measure of the position. In some occasions, a fourth (4D) dimension, time, is used to show the position of an event in time and Space (physics).
Diphthong	A diphthong (pronounced "DIF-thong" or "DIP-thong") is a vowel where the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make. It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound. A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the "oo" sound in "book." In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the "oi" sound in the word "oil". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an "o" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard "e" sound. Another example is the "ou" sound in the word "house". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft "a" sound in "flat", then moves to make the a hard "oo" sound like the one in "caboose". Just like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents. The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, di means two or double, while the part -phthong means sound or tone, from the basic word phthalein, which means speak, creating sound by the voice. A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely.
Diptych	Diptych can refer to two paintings that are joined together.
DirecTV	DirecTV (stylized as DIRECTV) is an United States satellite television service provider. The company is based in California. It is part of AT&T. Its satellite service began on June 17, 1994. The service provides digital satellite television to households in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean Islands. DirecTV also has internet television service.
Direct current	Direct current (DC or "continuous current (electricity)") is the flow of electricity in a single direction, from the positive to the negative terminals (electric potential, poles). The direct current always flow in the same direction, distinguishing it from the alternating current (AC). Direct current used to be called "Galvanic current". Batteries are some of the main sources of direct current (DC), but many other sources also exist such as bridge rectifiers in power supply, solar panels, etc. Typically, the current goes through a Electrical conductor and other things that can carry DC. DC is also sent through a vacuum as in Cathode rays or ion beams. The first commercial electric power transmission was developed by Thomas Edison in the late 19th century using direct current. Today nearly all electric power distribution uses alternating current because of the advantages with transformers and transmission. High-voltage direct current is often used for transporting electricity to places far away. For applications requiring direct current, the alternating current is typically distributed to a substation and then converted to direct current. Long after the usage of direct current had been established, physicists realized that the current was made of negative electric charges, the electrons, and that the actual flow was from the negative to the positive pole (and so-called "holes" flow in the opposite direction), but by convention, the usage of the term was never changed.
Disconnecting switch	A disconnecting switch (or disconnector) is an Electrical engineering switch used in high-voltage electrical circuits to isolate the section which has electricity from the section with no electricity. This is done for a full safety method during electrical equipment maintenance or service.
Discord (software)	Discord is a free instant messaging software that lets people talk to each other over the internet. It was originally meant for people who play Video game, but is now used by others. In addition to text messaging, you may also make audio and video calls through Discord. Discord is free to use, and it runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android (operating system), iOS, Linux, and in most Web browser. It has over 250 million users as of 21 July 2019.
Disk partition	A disk partition is a section of a data storage device (such as a hard disk). A disk partition can have one of file system, such as NTFS (found on Windows) to ext4 (found on Linux). Disk partitions start at one number and end at another. These numbers are addresses in the hard drive. The address points to one byte and ends at another on the disk. Different Partition table allow for different amounts of partitions on a given device. Master Boot Record (MBR) has a maximum of 4 partitions. GUID Partition Table (GPT) has a maximum of 128 partitions. Partitions can be edited by using a partition editor.
Displacement (psychology)	Displacement is a word used in Freudian psychology for is an unconscious defence mechanism. Example: the mind redirects thoughts, emotions, desires from an object or person felt to be dangerous or unacceptable to an object or person felt to be safe or acceptable. More generally, the substitute of one response by another, when the original response is blocked: displaced aggression.
Displacement vector	A displacement vector is a concept from mathematics. It is a vector. It shows the direction and distance traveled with a straight line. It is often used in physics to display the speed, acceleration and distance of an object traveled (relative to a reference point or an object's starting position).
Disposable and discretionary income	Disposable income is the income someone has after they have paid their taxes. Mathematically, it is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In national accounts definitions, personal income minus income tax equals disposable personal income.
Dissenting opinion	A dissenting opinion (or dissent) is an Legal opinion in a legal case. It is written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court. In some cases, they simply declare a disagreement with the majority opinion. In other cases they may be used to instruct, prod, or otherwise try to convince other Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States of the point of view expressed by the minority. When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report. Dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions. They are also delivered and publishing at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. However, they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's Holding (law) should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law. A later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular rule of law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often highlight the precise holding of the majority opinion. Chief Justice of the United States Charles Evans Hughes stated in 1936: "A dissent in a Court of last resort is an appeal".<ref name=AboutAH/> The dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the existing case law, the application of different principles, or a different Judicial interpretation of the facts.
Dissociation (psychology)	Dissociation in psychology is an experience that involves a detachment/separation from reality. It is different from psychosis, psychosis is a loss of reality. It can describe many things. The mildest form of it involves things such as Daydream. A less mild form of it involves Altered state of consciousness. This is non-Pathology, meaning it is not considered a Disease or mental illness. These forms are often a coping mechanism or defense mechanism. This means that they protect against Stress (biology). When it becomes disruptive in a Human life, it becomes a mental illness. These mental illnesses are known as dissociative disorders. These include Fugue state, depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), and dissociative identity disorder. They can be triggered by Psychological trauma, stress, drugs, or no known reason. Sometimes other mental illnesses can involve dissociation. These include acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder.
Dissociative identity disorder	Dissociative identity disorder (DID), is a mental disorder.It was called multiple personality disorder (MPD). This is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it. The main symptoms of DID are a person showing two or more "identities" or "personality states". The person behaves differently depending which identity is in control. The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget. A person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by drugs, illness or (with children) pretending to play with imaginary friends. Most patients with DID are also diagnosed with other mental disorders.
Distributed generation	Distributed generation is the electricity generation system in which the electricity is being produced from many small power supply connected to the electrical grid. Distributed generation allows the [[:wikt:collection|collection]] of energy from many scattered sources to improve the security of an electricity supply.
Distributed revision control	A revision control software a tool programmers use to keep track of who wrote what and when it was written in a programs source code. It can also be used to restore old versions if someone makes a mistake.
Distribution board	A distribution board is a component of an Electricity system. It separates the power supply into several Electrical circuit in an enclosure. It provides each circuit with its Power system protection by using a fuse or circuit breaker.
Document Object Model	The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of an HTML website's properties. By using DOM, an HTML page can be modified (elements of it can be removed, changed, or new elements can be added).
Documenta	documenta is one of the most important exhibitions of modern art in the earth. Since 1955, it takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany. More than 1.2 million people visited the last one, documenta 14, which was held in 2017. The next one, documenta 15, will be from June 18 to September 25, 2022.
Domain Name System	The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to convert a computer's host name into an Internet Protocol on the Internet. For example, if a computer needs to communicate with the web server example.net, your computer needs the IP address of the web server example.net. It is the job of the DNS to convert the host name to the IP address of the web server. It is sometimes called the Internet's telephone book because it converts a Website's name that people know to a number that the Internet actually uses. The DNS is defined by Request for Comments (RFC) documents. These are technical documents about computer networks. The DNS is mainly defined by RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. There are later RFC which define changes to the system.
Domain hack	A domain hack is a domain name that blends the text in a web address' domain (before the dot) with its top level domain (after the dot) to create a word (such as youtu.be), or a phrase (such as play.it). These are called "hacks" because they use top level domains in ways that they were not intended to be used. In the example above, YouTube uses .be as part of their link shortening service, even though .be was meant to be used as a country code top level domain (ccTLD) for Belgium. Entercom Communications Corporation does the same thing with their play.it domain name, using Italy's ccTLD. Matthew Doucette first used the term "domain hack" in a blog post on November 3rd, 2004.
Domestic partnership	A Domestic partnership is a contract between two people who live together. They live together in the same household, but are neither marriage, nor joined in what is called a civil union. The sex of the partners is not relevant.
Domestication	Domestication is a change that happens in wild animals or plants, when they are kept by humans for a long time. The Latin term literally means "to make it suitable for home". If humans take wild animals and plants and keep and breed them, over time the animals and plants may change. The animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them, and they change in ways that are better for human use. This change (domestication) happens by humans choosing which animals will breed the next generation. Biologists call this method artificial selection. The first domestication of plants happened during the first use of agriculture. Humans first domesticated dogs. In the Neolithic revolution, people domesticated sheep and goats, and later cattle and pigs. Domesticated plants are crops or ornamental plants. People use domesticated animals as livestock, that is for food, clothing, and work. Otherwise, the domesticated animals may be kept as pets.
Dominance (ethology)	In the context of the behaviour of animals, dominance means that one animal, or a small group has a high social status. Because of this status, these animals get better access to resources, such as food. Dominance (and submission, the contrary) is always linked to the relationship of two animals, one of them has a higher social status than the other.
Door god	A door god is a painting pasted on a door. These were used by the China as good luck. Door gods can be seen on temples - places of religion - and other buildings. There is a belief that door gods stop evil spirits from going into the building. Door gods are often in pairs, one for each side of the door. The first door gods may have been made for a Chinese Emperor, more than 1300 years ago. They showed his two best soldiers.
Double helix	In geometry, a double helix (plural double helices) is two helices with the same axis, but they differ by a translation along the axis. The term is most often used in reference to the nucleic acid double helix, the main structure of nucleic like DNA and RNA.
Dow Chemical	Dow Chemical is a company which has its headquarters in the United States. It is the second-largest producer of chemicals in the world, after BASF.
Download	Download means getting information from another computer or server. The opposite of downloading is uploading, which is sending data to another computer. Usually we do not say "download" for a single web page (for example when you open this page on your computer). When we say we downloaded something, it is normally a bigger computer file, like Information or a computer program. The word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from an owner for one's use. The source is expected to be authentic and have the right to send it. At the user's end, the downloaded information or data are to be used based on copyright. In the 21st century, it is very easy to download files or informations - legally or not - from the internet.
Drainage	Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and groundwater from a given area. Many Agriculture soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies.
Drawing	Drawing is a way of making a picture. Drawings are created by making lines on a surface. Long lines make up the shapes and small lines make the textures. Drawings can be images of real-life or abstract images showing ideas that cannot be seen in the real world. A drawing is the art created this way. Examples of things used to mark with are pencils, chalk, charcoal, crayons, pastels, markers, wax colored pencils, pen and ink. Artists have been drawing for many centuries. They draw on paper or on other surfaces on which the marks show up. Drawing techniques include sketching, shading, cubism and many more. Between 1912 and 1948 art competitions were a part of the Olympics. Drawings can be made using many different media. It can be multimedia.
Dream	Dreams are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are sleeping. They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange. Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep. Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming, but keeps having the dream. This is called a lucid dream. This happens very little for most people, but for some people it happens often. During lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream, and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they can't do in the real world. Most people remember their dreams in some way or another, even if it is only a small part, but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly. It is often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up. Because of this, many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have. Nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people. Nightmares are usually based around that person's everyday fears, like spiders or dark places, but even a dream that's not about those things can feel unpleasant. Nightmares are caused by many different things: being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping, sickness, Stress (medicine), or even eating right before sleeping. There are many different Theory about why people dream and what their dreams mean. Every person has different dreams. Some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind (the part of the mind that works by itself). Others think that people, places, and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamer's real life. Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them, and have often used them for divination or fortune-telling. Today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams.
Dream Market	Dream Market is an online darknet market started in late 2013.<ref name="ddw" /> Dream Market works on a hidden service of the Tor (software). This allows online users to browse anonymously and securely while dodging possible monitoring of traffic. The marketplace sells many things, including drugs, stolen data, and Counterfeit, using the Bitcoin, BitcoinCash and Monero cryptocurrency. Dream provides an escrow service, with disputes handled by staff. The market also has forums, hosted on a different URL. After the takeovers and shutdowns of the AlphaBay and Hansa markets in July 2017, there was much speculation that Dream Market would become the main darknet marketplace. Many sellers and buyers from AlphaBay and Hansa (market) communities registered on Dream Market. At the time, Dream Market was reported to have "57,000 listings for Illegal_drugs and 4,000 listings for opioids". Dream Administrator and vendor Gal Vallerius was arrested in August 2017, after a border search of his laptop confirmed his identity as online drug seller OxyMonster. $500,000 USD in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was discovered on his laptop. Vallerius is the subject of an continuing investigation about large online narcotics purchases which began in February 2016.
Dress clothes	Dress clothes are clothing that is less formal than formal wear but more formal than casual wear.
Dress code	A dress code is a rule about what people should wear. Many times these rules are obvious: they do not need to be written. For example, when walking around a city or going to work one needs to have appropriate clothes. These can change depending on different countries and cultures. At other times a dress code can be a written rule: this can happen for important events. Some private places might also have a dress code that people need to follow to be allowed in - for example churches and nightclubs. The way a person chooses their clothes can be very important in a social environment. Different types of clothes can give an idea of wealth a person has, what religion he follows, marital status, etc.
Driver's license	A driver's license, driver license, driver licence, or driving licence is an official document which states that a person may drive a motorized vehicle, such as a motorcycle, automobile, truck, or a bus.
Drum and bugle corps	A drum and bugle corps is similar to a marching band but it only has brass instruments, percussion instruments, and color guards. Armies used signal drums and bugles as signals for centuries. The modern drum and bugle corps came from military drum and bugle units coming back from World War I and the wars after it. Early drum and bugle corps was a year-round activity, where musicians performed at shows all the time. Now, most drum and bugle corps schedule tours during the summer, where they travel around the country, performing a new show every year, with different music and movements.
Drumhead court-martial	A drumhead court-martial is a court-martial that happens on the battlefield to hear important charges of crimes that happened during the battle. The term is said to come from the use of a drumhead as an improvised writing table.
Dry cleaning	Dry cleaning (or dry-cleaning) is any process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent (a chemical that can dissolve certain compounds) rather than water. The solvent used is usually tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene). The solvent is called "perc" in the industry and "dry-cleaning fluid" by the public. It is often used instead of hand washing fabrics. People use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing.
Due process	Due process is the legal that the government must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this is a due process , which s the rule of law.
Duel	A duel is a fight between two people who have similar deadly weapons and have agreed to a set of rules before the fight takes place. The fight is usually about a matter of honor. The goal of a duel is not usually to kill the opponent but to restore the honor of the man who declared the duel. Duels are not official laws, they are carried out by individuals. Duels were practiced from the 15th century to 20th century in Western societies. Burr–Hamilton duel, in 1804 in the United States the politicians Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton had a duel. Since the American Civil War, all U.S. states have criminalized dueling, with punishments for dueling ranging from not being allowed to run for public office to the death penalty. Dueling was outlawed because groups against dueling formed and were successful.
Duet	A duet is a musical Composition (music) for two performers, most often used for a vocal or piano duet. For other instruments, the word duo is often used. The word duet is used in any of the following ways:
Duty to rescue	Duty to rescue is a concept that many law systems have: In certain cirumstances, someone can be held responsible for not helping another person who is in danger, and who would be injured, or who would die, if not helped. People are required to help to the best of their abilities. As a bare minimum, this often means alerting emergency services. Not all law systems have this concept, and in general the following is true:
Duverger's law	In political science, Duverger's law holds that plurality voting system elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas "the two-round system and proportional representation tend to favor Multi-party system".https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=lRulXryMAsilmAXp...
Dynamic-link library	Dynamic-link library (also written as Dynamic Link Library or DLL), is the Microsoft's implementation of shared library used by the Microsoft Windows operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for Windows legacy Device drivers). Any of the Microsoft Windows data computer file having the same file format as that of the Dynamic-link library can be called a resource DLL. Examples of such DLLs include Icon (computing) libraries, sometimes having the extension ICL, and the font files, having the extensions FON and FOT.
E. B. Ford	Edmund Brisco Ford Fellow of the Royal Society (23 April 1901 – 2 January 1988) was a United Kingdom Ecology Genetics. He was a leader among those British biologists who investigated the role of natural selection in nature. As a schoolboy Ford became interested in lepidoptera, the group of insects which includes butterfly and moths. He went on to study the genetics of natural populations, and invented the field of ecological genetics. Ford was awarded the Royal Society's Darwin Medal in 1954. Later, in 1968, he was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science.
EFF DES cracker	In cryptography, the EFF DES cracker (nicknamed "Deep Crack") is a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to perform a brute force attack search of Data Encryption Standard cipher's key space — that is, to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key. The aim in doing this was to prove that DES's key is not long enough to be secure. The Data Encryption Standard uses a 56-bit Key size, meaning that there are 256 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted. This is approximately 7.21 (more than 72 Names for large numbers). When DES was approved as a federal standard in 1976, a machine fast enough to test such a number of keys in a reasonable time would have cost an unreasonable amount of money to build.
ELIZA	ELIZA is an early natural language processing. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts. The most famous script was called DOCTOR. It was a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapy. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR sometimes provided like a human. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966. When the person used words that were not in the very small list,DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to "My head hurts", "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.
ESTREAM	eSTREAM is a project to identify "new stream ciphers that might become suitable for widespread adoption", organized by the European Union ECRYPT network. It was set up because of the failure of all six stream ciphers submitted to the NESSIE project. The call for primitives was first issued in November 2004. The project was completed in April 2008. The project was divided into separate phases and the project goal was to find algorithms suitable for different kinds of application.
EasyBCD	EasyBCD is a free program developed by the non-profit NeoSmart Technologies used to configure and tweak the new Windows Vista Bootloader. EasyBCD can be used to set up dual-boots between Windows Vista and previous versions of Windows, along with Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X.
Eating disorder	An eating disorder is when someone begins eating too much, or when someone begins to avoid eating. This affects one's mental and physical health. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are two of the most well known eating disorders today. Eating disorders affect 5-7% of American women, and only a small percent of men are affected. Eating disorders involve more than just food. Many people with eating disorders are very sad and feel alone. They get depressed and do not want to eat in front of other people. They might use food as a way to cope, or they might restrict their food intake as a means of control. They might eat a lot of food in a very short period of time. They might throw up their food because they feel guilty. They might eat very little because they want to lose weight, even if they are already dangerously underweight (weighing less than what it is considered healthy). Even if they are underweight, they might see themselves as very fat. Many people with eating disorders suffer physical complications, like malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients that the body needs to be healthy), or electrolyte imbalances (a change in the amount of elements such as sodium or potassium that causes problems in the body's ability to work properly). Eating disorders can cause death. On 1 December 2013 the Daily Telegraph reported that the number of children under thirteen treated in hospital for eating disorders in the UK had tripled.
Ecclesiastical court	There are different Christian denomination in Christianity. Over time, each of these movements developed a number of rules to follow. An ecclesiastical court is a court of law that only uses one of these sets of rules to judge people. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, these rules are known as Canon law, and they can be found in the Codex Iuris Canonici.
Ecohydrology	Ecohydrology is the scientific study of how water interacts with Ecological system. It is a subdiscipline of hydrology, that focuses on the ecology. These Interaction may happen in a Body of water, such as River and Lake, or on land, in Forest, Desert, and other Terrestrial ecosystem. Areas of research in ecohydrology include transpiration, how plants use water, adaptation of Organism to their environment in the water, effects of vegetation and Benthos Plant on smoving water, and interactions between ecological processes and the hydrological cycle.
Ecological economics	Ecological economics (also called eco-economics, ecolonomy or bioeconomics of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen) is both a transdisciplinary and an interdisciplinary field of academic research about the coevolution of human economy and natural ecosystems. By treating the economy as a system of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by the preservation of natural capital, the field of ecological economics is different from environmental economics.
Ecological genetics	Ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations. This contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level. Research in ecological genetics is on Trait (biology) related to fitness, which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, defence against predators. Research usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of death in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.
Ecological niche	An ecological niche is the part of the environment into which a species fits, and to which it is adaptation. A shorthand definition of niche in biology is how an organism makes a living in a place. However, the term has been used in different ways.<ref name=Pocheville2015>Pocheville, Arnaud et al 2015. The ecological niche: history and recent controversies. In Heams, Thomas (ed) Handbook of evolutionary thinking in the sciences. Dordrecht: Springer. pp. 547–586. ISBN 978-94-017-9014-7</ref><ref name=Levin>Three variants of ecological niche are described by </ref> It is not only a place but a way of life. For example, grazers, insectivores, scavengers and predators can all live their different lifestyles in the same forest. A niche can be occupied by different species in different places even though they 'earn their living' in roughly the same way. Thus the 'bird of prey eating small mammals' niche would in grasslands include the kestrel, but in an oak wood it would be filled by the tawny owl. The idea of a niche in natural history is ancient: many writers noticed that animals and plants live in places where they are well adapted to live. The word niche was first used in biology by naturalist Roswell Johnson, but in 1917 Joseph Grinnell was the first to use it in a research program. Later, he described the niches of a variety of species. Grinnell was the first to offer the "exclusion principle" in which only one species could occupy a particular niche at any one time. Scientists who study the interactions between living things, such as animals and their environment are called ecologists, and their branch of science is called ecology. A niche is a term which describes a position or opportunity into which some organism fits well. Thus, an ecological niche is a place in nature that is filled by an animal or plant because it is well suited to do so.
Ecological succession	Ecological succession, is the process by which a specific ecology has more or less orderly and predictably changed after a disturbance like a fire. In long-term studies, there is a species succession process in the way forests develop.
Ecological yield	Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest. However, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).
Ecology	Ecology is the branch of biology that studies the biota (living things), the environment, and their interactions. It comes from the Greek language oikos = house; logos = study. Ecology is the study of ecosystems. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity, ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists. Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus. There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agriculture, forestry, fishing), city planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.
Ecosystem services	Ecosystem services are processes by which the natural environment produces natural resource useful to people, as to economic services. They include:
Eddy current	An eddy current can be made when you have a solenoid (coil of wire), in which there is a soft iron core. When you connect the solenoid to an alternating current power source, metal objects held above the cross sectional area of the solenoid are repelled due to Lenz's Law.
Edge effect	Edge Effect: in Eddy Current is The electromagnetic field produced by an excited test coil extends in all directions from the coil. As test objects geometrical boundaries are approached by the test coil, they are sensed by the coil prior to the coil's arrival at the boundary.
Edge effects (ecology)	In ecology, edge effects are changes in population or community structures that occur at the border of two or more places of living. As the edge effects get bigger, there is greater biodiversity in the habitat at the border.
Education Loan Finance	Education Loan Finance, also known as ELFI, is a division of SouthEast Bank based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tennessee. Launched in December 2015, ELFI is a national private lending company that refinances graduate and undergraduate student loan debt. In 2016, the company introduced a state-of-the-art loan application system, designed for borrowers to consolidate outstanding education loans into one single loan. By March 2021, the company completed over $1.6 billion in student loan refinancing.
Ego depletion	Ego depletion is the idea that people get tired of making decisions because it is a neuro-chemical process that requires energy.
Egocentrism	Egocentrism is a state of mind of putting oneself in the center of interest, of being interested more about oneself than about other people. While this is normal in young child, it becomes more and more of a problem, in older children, adolescent and adults. To egocentric people, self-relevant information is seen as more important in shaping one’s judgments than are thoughts about others and other-relevant information. The term egocentrism was mostly coined by Piaget, a psychologist. Egocentrism is different from both egoism and narcissism. Young children are egocentric: they see themselves as the "center" of the world. Developing self-conscience requires the perception that there are others, that there is socialistion with other people, and that there are differences between oneself and other people. Egocentric people are often unable to fully understand or to cope with other people's opinions. The fact that reality can be different from what they are ready to accept is difficult for them.
Elder abuse	Elder abuse (also senior abuse) is a single or repeated act of [[:wikt:abuse|abuse]] towards an elderly person. It can also be when a lack of good care causes [[:wikt:harm|harm]] or [[:wikt:distress|distress]] to an older person. It can be physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or verbal abuse. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect. Elder abuse happens when there is an "[[:en:wikt:expectation|expectation]] of [[:wikt:trust|trust]]" by the older person toward their [[:wikt:abuser|abuser]]. Usually the abuser is someone the older person knows or with whom they have a Interpersonal relationship. This could be a [[:wikt:spouse|spouse]], [[:wikt:partner|partner]] or family [[:wikt:member|member]], a friend or [[:wikt:neighbor|neighbor]]. It could be a caregiver that the older person depends on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence. Abuse can happen to any older adult, but often affects those who depend on others for help with activities of everyday life — including bathing, dressing, and taking medicine. People who are frail may appear to be easy victims. In North and South American epidemiological studies, the prevalence of elder abuse ranged from about 10 per cent among cognitively intact older adults to 47 per cent in older adults with dementia, researchers found. In Europe, the prevalence varied from 2 per cent in Ireland to 61 per cent in Croatia. In Africa, the prevalence ranged between 30 per cent and 44 per cent. Elder abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others. Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse.
Electric arc	An electric arc is an electricity breakdown of a gas which produces a plasma (physics) spark. The electric arc was first described in 1801. Electric arcs are used for welding, plasma cutting and lighting for stage performances. Electric arc furnaces are used in making steel and other things.
Electric charge	Electric charge is a basic property of electrons, protons and other subatomic particles. Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged. Things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on (attract) each other. This makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms. Things that have the same charge push each other away (they repel each other). This is called the Law of Charges. It was discovered by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. The law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called Coulomb's law. Things that have equal numbers of electrons and protons are neutral. Things that have more electrons than protons are negatively charged, while things with fewer electrons than protons are positively charged. Things with the same charge repel each other. Things that have different charges attract each other. If possible, the one with too many electrons will give enough electrons to match the number of protons in the one that has too many protons for its load of electrons. If there are just enough electrons to match the extra protons, then the two things will not attract each other anymore. When electrons move from a place where there are too many to a place where there are too few, that is called an electrical current. When a person shuffles their feet on a carpet and then touches a brass doorknob, they may get an electrical shock. If there are enough extra electrons then the force with which those electrons push each other away may be enough to make some of the electrons jump across a gap between the person and the doorknob. The length of the spark is a measure of voltage or "electrical pressure." The number of electrons that move from one place to another per unit of time measured as amperage or "rate of electron flow." If a person gets a positive or negative charge, it may make the person's hairs stand up because the charges in each hair push it away from the others. Electric charge felt when one gets a shock from a doorknob or other object usually is between 25 thousand and 30 thousand volts. However, the electric current only flows briefly, so the flow of electrons through the person's body does not cause physical harm. On the other hand, when clouds gain electrical charges they have even higher voltages and the amperage (the number of electrons that will flow in the lightning strike) can be very high. That means that electrons can jump from a cloud to the earth (or from the earth to a cloud). If those electrons go through a person, then the electric shock can burn or kill.
Electric current	An electric current is a flow of electric charge. The equation of current is:
Electric match	An electric match is a device that uses electricity to [[w:igite|ignite]] a flammable compound. Usually, it is made of two wires. When an electric current is applied to the two wires, they will ignite the compound. Electric matches are used when it is important to know the exact time at which the compound catches fire. Example uses include airbags, Pyrotechnics devices (Firework) and Explosive material. Because they can be used to ignite explosives, some countries have trade restrictions on electric matches.
Electric potential	Electric potential is potential energy (EPE) per unit of charge. (The Unit of measurement of energy is the joule and the unit of charge is the coulomb.) Electric potential tells what the electric potential energy of a charged object will be for every coulomb of charge it has, or how many joules of energy there will be per coulomb. The unit for electric potential, joule per coulomb, it is named the volt in memory of Alessandro Volta. One volt equals one joule per coulomb.
Electric power	Electric power is defined as the power dissipated by an electric circuit. Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time. The SI unit for power is the watt, the unit for energy is the joule, and the unit for time is the second. For a direct current circuit, electric power equals the electric current multiplied by the voltage. When electric current flows through a circuit, it is slowed down by the electrical resistance in the circuit. Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work (physics), such as heat radiation, light emission, kinetic energy, or sound vibrations.
Electric power distribution	Electric power distribution is the delivery system of electricity to places that use it, such as homes and other buildings. It is done mainly by power lines, transformers, Electrical substation and Electricity meter. The electricity comes from the power station at high voltage and is delivered at medium to low voltage levels. In early days, electricity was distributed as direct current (DC). Alternating current (AC) was later introduced during the War of Currents. DC distribution disappeared because transformers can easily convert AC to high voltage for electric power transmission and low voltage to use at home.
Electric power transmission	Electric power transmission is the transmitting of electricity to places where it will be used. Specifically, it is the bulk transfer of electrical power from the power plant to Electrical substation near populated areas. Electric power distribution is the delivery from the substation to the consumers. Due to the large amount of power and long distances, transmission normally takes place at high voltage (110 kV or above). Electricity is usually transmitted over long distance through overhead power transmission lines. Underground cable power transmission is used only in densely populated areas (such as large cities) because of the high cost of installation and maintenance and because the power losses increase dramatically compared with overhead transmission unless superconductors and cryogenic technology are used. A power transmission system is sometimes referred to colloquially as a "grid"; however, for reasons of economy, the network is rarely a true grid. redundancy (engineering) paths and lines are provided so that power can be routed from any power plant to any load center, through a variety of routes, based on the economics of the transmission path and the cost of power.
Electric switchboard	An electric switchboard is an electrical device that directs electricity from one place to another. It is usually in the form of electrical panel in an Electrical enclosure, which contains switches for such purposes. One of the more common configurations for an electric switchboard is a series of interconnected electrical panels. Each of the panels in turn features a series of switches that make it possible to control the flow of electricity. Making use of the switches, it is possible to adjust the voltage that is transmitted to connected devices, ensuring that the flow is not sufficient to cause damage to the circuitry. From this perspective, the electric switchboard can be viewed as a way of enhancing the safety of using electricity in the operation of various appliances, machinery, and other devices.
Electrical cell	An electrical cell is a machine used to generate electricity, or to make chemical reactions by applying electricity. A battery is one or more cells, connected. This cell is also known as electrochemical cell.
Electrical circuit	A circuit is a closed path that consists of circuit components in which electrons from a voltage or Electric current source can flow. If the circuit consists of electric components like a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor etc. then it will be called an Electrical circuit and if the circuit consists of any of the electronic circuit components like a diode, a Transistor etc. then it will be called an Electronic circuit. So, the electronic circuits may consist both of the electrical and electronic circuit components, but an electrical circuit will have only the electrical components. The point where electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the "source" of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the "return" or "earth ground". The exit point is called the "return" because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit. The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's "load". The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power home appliances like refrigerators, televisions, or lamps or more complicated, such as the load on the output of a Hydropower Power station. Circuits use two forms of electrical power: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by power stations. DC powers battery-operated Electric car and other machines and electronics. Converters can change AC to DC and vice versa. High-voltage direct current transmission uses big converters.
Electrical conductivity	Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the siemens (unit) per metre, (ampere2second3metre−3kilogram−1) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm−1. It is the ratio of the electric current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test.
Electrical enclosure	An electrical enclosure is a Cupboard used to hold electrical equipment. It keeps the equipment safely separated from people to prevent electrical shock.
Electrical energy	Electrical energy can refer to several closely related things. It can mean:
Electrical engineering	Electrical engineering is a subject of engineering. Its goal is to develop (think and make) different things that use electricity in a helpful way. Electrical engineers fix or design new and better ways of using devices that use electricity. Big subjects in electrical engineering include power generation, automation and control of robots, digital systems, and information technology (using radio and Computer to move and use data). To meet new needs, electrical engineering produced new specialties, such as electronic engineering and software engineering.
Electrical filament	An light bulb has a small thin wire with two bigger wires holding it up. This wire is called a filament. The filament is the part of the light bulb that produces light. Filaments in incandescent light bulbs are made of tungsten. Whenever an electric current goes through the filament, the filament glows. It may also be known as the electron emitting element in a vacuum tube. To make the bulb produce more light, the filament is usually made of coils of fine wire, also known as the coiled coil. [[en:Incandescent light bulb#Filament]]
Electrical generator	A generator usually means a machine that makes electricity energy. It has a generator head with wires, spinning inside a magnetic field. The resulting electromagnetic induction makes electricity flow through the wires. Hybrid electric vehicles carry a generator powerful enough to make them go. The biggest generators don't go anywhere; they stay in power stations. Different things can be used to make the generator head spin. Some small ones are cranked by someone's arms or legs. Bigger ones are connected to an engine. The biggest ones use a steam engine turbine or hydroelectric water power. Some use wind power. Whatever makes it turn, the generator converts this energy into electrical energy. Some portable generators have an internal combustion engine. They are harmful when used indoors because they make carbon monoxide.
Electrical grid	An electrical grid is a connection network of Electricity generation, Electric power transmission, Electric power distribution and Electrical load. The grid connects all of those parts in power systems to deliver power from the generators at the power station to the customers or load center which will use the electricity.
Electrical impedance	Electrical impedance is the amount of opposition that a circuit presents to Electric current or voltage change. The two main ways to write an impedance are:(see the 2nd figure, "complex impedance plane")
Electrical machine	An electrical machine is an electrical device that changes energy from one form to another, usually from mechanical energy to electrical energy or from electrical energy to mechanical energy.
Electrical resistance	The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty of passing an electric current through a substance. It explains the relationship between voltage (amount of electrical pressure) and the Electric current (flow of electricity). With more resistance in a circuit, less electricity will flow through the circuit. The inverse of resistance is conductance, a measure not much used. All objects have some resistance, except Superconductor. Resistance, discovered by Georg Ohm in 1827, is the ratio between voltage and current. Ohm's law said that the voltage between any two points in a Electrical conductor changes directly as the current between the two points, given the temperature remains the same. He described it with the equation:
Electrical substation	An electrical substation is a subsidiary station of an electricity Electricity generation, electric power transmission and Electric power distribution system where voltage is transformed from high to low or the reverse using transformers. Electric power may flow through several substations between generating plant and consumer, and may be changed in voltage in several steps.
Electricity	Electricity is the presence and flow of electric charge. Using electricity we can transfer energy in ways that allow us to do simple chores. Its best-known form is the flow of electrons through conductors such as copper wires. The word "electricity" is sometimes used to mean "electrical energy". They are not the same thing: electricity is a transmission medium for electrical energy, like sea water is a transmission medium for wave energy. An item which allows electricity to move through it is called a electrical conductor. Copper wires and other metal items are good conductors, allowing electricity to move through them and transmit electrical energy. Plastic is a bad conductor (also called an insulator) and doesn’t allow much electricity to move through it so it will stop the transmission of electrical energy. Transmission of electrical energy can happen naturally (such as lightning), or be made by people (such as in a generator). It can be used to power machines and Electronics. When electrical charges are not moving, electricity is called static electricity. When the charges are moving they are an electric current, sometimes called 'dynamic electricity'. Lightning is the most known - and dangerous - kind of electric current in nature, but sometimes static electricity causes things to stick together in nature as well. Electricity can be dangerous, especially around water because water is a form of good conductor as it has impurities like salt in it. Salt can help electricity flow. Since the nineteenth century, electricity has been used in every part of our lives. Until then, it was just a curiosity seen in the lightning of a thunderstorm. Electrical energy can be created if a magnet passes close to a metal wire. This is the method used by a generator. The biggest generators are in power stations. Electrical energy can also be released by combining chemicals in a jar with two different kinds of metal rods. This is the method used in a battery. Static electricity can be created through the friction between two materials - for instance a wool cap and a plastic ruler. This may make a spark. Electrical energy can also be created using energy from the sun, as in photovoltaic cells. Electrical energy arrives at homes through wires from the places where it is made. It is used by electric lamps, electric heatings, etc. Many appliances such as washing machines and electric cookers use electricity. In factories, electrical energy powers machines. People who deal with electricity and electrical devices in our homes and factories are called "electricians".
Electricity meter	An electricity meter (or energy meter) is a Machine that Measurement the amount of electricity used by a house or business. Measurements are usually taken in kilowatt hours (kWh).
Electrocution	Electrocution or electric shock is when electricity passes through something alive. It happens when the human body gets in contact with electricity. The word "electrocution" originated as a Portmanteau word between electricity and execution, referring to those executed by electric chair, but has evolved to describe any fatal encounter with electricity. Nonfatal encounters are called electric shocks, or simply a "shock". The human body is affected by electric current (measured in Ampere). If the electric current is strong, it can stop heartbeat and cause death. High current can cause severe burns and even fry the victim alive. In order for current to flow through a body you need a sufficiently high voltage, typically more than 50 volts AC, and the voltage generator must be able to supply enough current. Super high voltages, such as from a small Tesla coil, supply such a small amount of current that a person feels just a tickle. A large Tesla coil can burn and kill. Safety devices like a Residual-current_device try to protect humans from any current greater than 5 to 30 mA (0.005 to 0.03 Amps). Human muscles are paralyzed -- you cannot move an affected arm or leg -- at currents from 10 to 20 mA; as a result a victim may be unable to let go of a wire that is shocking him. At around 20 mA breathing is difficult. At about 75mA breathing stops. At 100 mA the heart fibrillates -- death is quick. At 200 mA you get severe musculature contractions and burning.
Electrocyclic reaction	In organic chemistry, an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic reaction rearrangement reaction. The reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond. Electrocyclic reactions share the following property:
Electrode	An electrode is an electrical conductor that carries electricity. It is used to touch a non-metal part of a Electrical circuit. The two types of electrodes are anode and cathode.
Electroluminescence	Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical event in which a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field. The electric energy is absorbed by electron in the ground state and is excited to the higher state of energy called the excited state.The excited state is not the stable state and the electron jumps back to the ground state and emits the photon related to the bandgap of the material.
Electrolysis of water	Electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen gas. This technique can be used to produce breath oxygen or hydrogen gas as a fuel source, referred to as hydrogen fuel. However, that method is more expensive than the industry way to produce hydrogen fuel from natural gas. This is what is referred to as a non-spontaneous reaction which requires impetus. At the cathode, reduction (in this case, the gain of electrons) occurs. At the anode, oxidation (in this case, the loss of electrons) occurs. Normally, the reaction is balanced with either an acid or a base as shown in the equations below.
Electrolyte	An electrolyte is a chemical that conducts electrical current. It is used in battery to make the ions flow, producing current. Electrolytes ionize when dissolved in suitable solvents such as water. Most soluble salts, acids, and bases are electrolytes. An electrolyte used in "electrolytic cells" carries the ions between the electrodes of the cell. Electrolytic cells may be used to extract constituent chemical element and chemical compound contained in the solution. A correct concentration of electrolytes is important to physiology.
Electron affinity	Electron affinity is a phrase used in chemistry. When an atom that is Neutral particle gets an electron, the energy that is changed in the atom is the electron affinity. Across a period, the electron affinity increases.
Electron configuration	An electron configuration is the arrangement of electrons within an atom. The electron configuration describes where the electrons are inside atomic orbital. The structure of the Periodic table is partly based on electron configuration. There are four kinds of electron configurations: s, p, d, and f orbitals. S orbitals are roughly sphere-shaped, p orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell, d orbitals are usually shaped like a four-leaf clover, and f orbitals form a mathematically complex shape. An atom can have more than one orbital; in fact, all except hydrogen do. Similarly, atoms can have more than one of each kind of orbital. The electron configurations fill up with electrons in an unchanging order. They describe how the electrons behave and orbit the nucleus.
Electron crystallography	Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). This method works in many cases where X-ray crystallography does not. The latter needs large 3-D crystals to work. Protein structures are usually done from 2-dimensional crystals (sheets or Helix), polyhedrons such as Virus capsids, or dispersed proteins. Electrons can be used in these situations, whereas X-rays cannot, because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X-rays do. Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The method was invented by Aaron Klug, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this, and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA, in 1982. The first electron crystallographic protein structure to be solved was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990.Since then, several other high-resolution structures have been done by electron crystallography, including the light-harvesting complex, and the bacterial flagellum.<ref>Yonekura K, Maki-Yonekura S, Namba K. 2003. Complete atomic model of the bacterial flagellar filament by electron cryomicroscopy. Nature 424, p643PMID 12904785</ref>
Electronic signature	An electronic signature is an electronics record of an agreement. Contract have been used for a long time to show that two parties agree on something. Often these parties will then write a document that they both sign to show this agreement. In the times of the internet, many of these documents are transmitted in digital form, but showing agreement is still needed. That is where an electronic signature comes in. The concept of electornic sgnature itself is not new. English law jurisdictions have recognized Telegraphy signatures as far back as the mid-19th century, and faxed signatures since the 1980s. Electronic signatures exist in different forms. All forms can show that somebody agreed with something. Some forms can also protect the data the person agreed with from being changed easily, or they can legally identify the person that agreed. To do this, ideas from public-key cryptography are used: Digital signature, Digital certificates, and hash codes. An electronic signature often includes a timestamp to show when the signature was made. Much like cryptography, electronic signatures can be used for any kind of data, there is no requirement that the data signed has a specific format. Even though cryptography is often used, the term electronic signature has a Law meaning. This is different from the technical term digital signature used in cryptography. Many countries have made regulations so that some electronic signatures are equivalent to a handwritten signature for many purposes. There are different ways in which an electronic signature can be done. Many countries have standards as to what such a signature must look like. Examples for such regulations are eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the United States or ZertES in Switzerland.
Electronic system	A electronic system that is powered by electricity, and it processes Information, Data storage, or any raw material from input into a desired output for further usage in life.
Electrostatics	Electrostatics (also known as static electricity) is the branch of physics that deals with apparently stationary electric charges. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. This is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive surface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects to be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to the ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with Conduction surfaces.
Elliptic curve	An elliptic curve is a plane curve of Degree (mathematics) 3 that can be described using the following formula: y^2=x^3+ax+b, where a and b are Integer.
Elu (Portuguese pronoun)	The Elu system () is based on a set of linguistic proposals created with the purpose of preparing the Portuguese language with a neuter grammatical gender. The most prominent proposal is the personal Neopronoun elu, delu, nelu, and daquelu, intended to be a proposal for how to refer to non-binary people (whose gender identity is not male or female) or whose gender is unknown, or irrelevant, as well as groups with different genders, without resorting to the "generic masculine". These proposals can be used by and for anyone, regardless of gender. The pronoun elu tries to present the least number of problems in its use when trying to function smoothly in oral speech, listening, writing and visual identification, creating similarity between ela ("she"), ele ("he"), and elu (functionally similar to singular they). Nouns in Portuguese all have grammatical gender, and this gender impacts some grammatical Inflection. Grammatical gender is different from personal gender identity―rather, words referring to a generic individual with unknown gender identity still carries grammatical gender. For example, the word pessoa ("person") is grammatically feminine, but indicates no specific gender of the person referred to. The gender inflection appears explicitly when in the context of an inflectied adjective. With the feminine nouns such as cidade ("city"; plural cidades), the adjective meaning "beautiful" (currently written generically as belo in dictionaries) would become cidade bela, cidades belas ("beautiful city/cities"). Likewise, this works with a masculine noun such as carro ("car"; plural carros): carro belo, carros belos ("beautiful car/cars"). The Portuguese language as a rule determines that the plural of Noun, when covering individuals of the feminine and masculine gender, is made based on the generic masculine: a collective of vinte meninas ("twenty girls") and dez meninos ("ten boys"), is said as trinta meninos (literally, "thirty boys"). This form of plural formation is considered Sexism by certain groups and individuals, resulting in proposals for a neutral gender to be adopted, such as "thirty children" (trinta menines). A similar known neopronoun in Portuguese is ile, also called sistema ile ("ile system"), was popularized in 2020. The systems happen to be same when applying neolanguage beyond pronouns, they use ⟨-e⟩ Suffix.
Embodiment theory	Embodiment theory is the idea that human thought is comes from parts of the body other than the brain and not only from the brain.
Emotional intelligence	Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to know, understand, and manage emotions. People with high EI know their own emotions and the emotions of other people, and they are able to use emotions to think and live better. This thought model claims that high EI helps people to be successful in life.There are several different models that disagree about the exact definition of the term. Even though there does not seem to be an exact definition, the model itself can be applied in various ways, across different domains. Nowadays, there are 3 main models of EI:
Empathy	Empathy is a word that means that someone is able to share or understand the emotions and feelings of another person. Someone may need to have a certain amount of empathy before they are able to feel compassion. The word was coined in 1909 by the English psychologist Edward.B. Titchener.
Empty Homes Tax	The City of Vancouver levies an empty home tax on homes that are unoccupied more than six months of the year. A home that is occupied by its owner or a tenant for at least six months is exempt. The rate of tax is one per cent of the home’s assessed value. A CBC report said that rental vacancy rate rose only 0.1% after the tax started. The report also said that the tax was going to bring the city $38 million. The city spent $10 million implementing this new tax in 2018. The City of Santa Cruz Empty Home Tax community driven ballot measure is currently seeking qualification for the November 2022 ballot and the associated group has registered with the California Secretary of State as a primarily formed ballot measure committee to support the qualification and passage of the ballot measure. The "Empty Home Tax" would levy a parcel tax on homes that are occupied for less than 120 days of the calendar year. A home that is occupied by owner or tenant for at least 120 days is exempt as are homes whose owners experience hardships such going into long term care, extended hospital stays and a defined set of other exemptions.
Emulator	An emulator is a computer program or hardware that makes one kind of computer behave like a different one, so that it can use the same computer programs or do the same things as the other one. They are best for using old software and computer games on newer computers. They can be Computer hardware that you add to the computer, or software that you use on it. Some types of emulators require newer computers that have the right system requirements. For example, you need a Central processing unit that is fast enough to meet the demands of the emulator. computer memory (both RAM and hard drive space) may be another factor to help it run smoothly and more accurately. With the more advanced emulators, if your computer is too old, the emulator or even the operating system may computer crash.
Enciclopedia d'arte italiana	The Enciclopedia d’Arte Italiana is an institution that publishes a biographical dictionary, the Enciclopedia d’Arte Italiana, Catalogo generale artisti dal 900 ad oggi, started in 2012 and completed in 2021.
Encryption	Encryption allows information to be hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge (such as a password). This is done with a secret code or cypher. The hidden information is said to be encrypted. Decryption is a way to change cyphertext back into plaintext. This is the decrypted form. The study of encryption is called cryptography. Cryptanalysis can be done by hand if the cypher is simple. Complex cyphers need a computer to search for possible keys. Decryption is a field of computer science and mathematics that looks at how difficult it is to break a cypher.
Endangered language	An endangered language is a language with very few native speakers, so it may become Extinct language.
English law	English law, also called common law, is the legal system of England and Wales. It is generally divided into criminal law and civil law. It spread to many parts of the former British Empire including Australia, Canada, the United States and New Zealand, and many other countries. English law is in that it is based on applying legal precedent to present and future decisions made by judges. However, there are publications that provide organized s of current laws.<ref name=DUKELAW/> Parliament has the power to create laws which are considered and may not be ed by the courts.<ref name=DUKELAW/> Only Parliament has the power to change a law.<ref name=DUKELAW/>
Enigma machine	The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I. It is a cypher machine: a way of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters (or, random letters). Each time a letter is typed, it appears as another letter in the alphabet. The choices are not random. They are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up. Every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position. German military messages done on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. Later, they designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma cyphers. From 1938 more complexity was added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult. On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles showed French and British intelligence agency their cryptanalysis of the Enigma, and promised each delegation a Polish-built Enigma. The demonstration was a vital start for the later British work at Bletchley Park.
Ensemble	An ensemble is a group of people who work or perform together. By extension, it can mean a coordinated outfit of clothing, or anything where a group contributes to a coordinated whole. The term is most used in music. A musical ensemble is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music. In classical music, trios or quartets often group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles or wind ensembles. The term is also used in jazz, where the instruments typically include wind instruments. An ensemble usually consists of three or four people with similar skill levels. The word originated in late middle English language (as an adverb) meaning "at the same time". It is from French language, based on the Latin language insimul. The noun dates from the mid 18th century.
Enterprise Java Beans	Enterprise Java Beans is a framework that allows one to develop Enterprise applications more easily using Java EE. It does this by using standard components. These components specify how an application works. This is usually called business logic. There are different kinds of Beans:
Entrapment	Entrapment is to commit a crime, especially by authorities, to get a conviction. The implication (grammar) is that the person might otherwise have been unlikely to commit the crime. In some countries, entrapment is a possible defence against criminal . Another similar term is agent provocateur, an older French language term for the person who does the inducing. A sting operation is a more sophisticated way to trap criminals. It usually involves leaving a bait, and filming or catching whoever takes the bait.
Entten tentten teelikamentten	Entten tentten teelikamentten is an old Finland nursery rhyme. Entten tentten teelikamenttenhissun kissun vaapula vissuneelin keelin klotviipula vaapula votEskon saun piun paun. Nyt sää lähdet tästä pelistä pois, Puh pah pelistä pois!
Environmental chemistry	Environmental chemistry is the science of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that in natural places. Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the Earth's atmosphere, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an Interdisciplinarity science that includes Atmospheric chemistry, Aquatic chemistry and soil chemistry, as well as uses analytical chemistry. It is related to Environmental science and other areas of science. It is different from green chemistry, which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source. Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works. It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally. It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals. Then, it accurately study the effects humans have on the Natural environment through the release of chemicals. Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the Ecosystem. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and Chemical equation, solutions, Units of measurement, Sampling (statistics), and Analytical chemistry. Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones.
Environmental impact of aviation	Air travel has a major impact on the world's environment, especially the atmosphere. With fast globalisation, air traffic has quickly increased, and is one of the biggest causes of climate change. This is due to the noise pollution emitted from the aircraft while it is flying. It also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle. Public awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with automobiles.
Environmental revitalization	Environmental revitalization is a process where plant life and other life is brought back to an area that was polluted, barren, contaminated, or turned into desert. Areas of environmental revitalization can be wetlands, meadows and forests.
Epic of Gilgamesh	The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia. It is one of the earliest works of literary fiction known. The most complete version that exists today was preserved on twelve clay tablets in the library collection of the 7th century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.A series of Sumerian legends and poems about the mythological hero-king Gilgamesh were probably gathered into a longer Akkadian language poem some time before the 7th century BC. The essential story is about the relationship between Gilgamesh, a king who has become distracted and disheartened by his rule, and a friend, Enkidu, who is half-wild and who undertakes dangerous quests with Gilgamesh. Much of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's thoughts of loss following Enkidu's death. It is often credited as being one of the first literary works with emphasis on immortality. The epic is widely read in translation, and the hero, Gilgamesh, has become an icon of popular culture.
Episode	An episode is a singular part of a story, radio or television program, they often follow in an order. They are often 20- 40 minutes long, and follow the same storyline.
Equal justice under law	Equal justice under law is a sentence on the front of the United States Supreme Court building in Washington D.C..
Equality (mathematics)	In mathematics, two things are equal if and only if they are exactly the same in every way. That is, they have the same (mathematical) value and the same mathematical properties. Mathematicians use the equals sign (=) to say this. This [[:wikt:define|defines]] a binary relation, equality. The statement "x = y" means that x and y are equal. Equivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an equivalence relation between two mathematical objects, that is, two mathematical objects are equivalent if they are related by this relation. In which case, the equivalence is often represented using the symbols \sim or \equiv. A statement that two Expression (mathematics)s denote equal quantities is an equation (or an equality). Equations are equal. Inequality are unequal. An equality is also a Transitivity (mathematics). This means that if one object is equal to a second object, and the second object is equal to a third object, then the first object is equal to the third object as well. Since a predicate is a way of describing something that is true, another way to say this is that if one thing that is true about a variable is not true about the other variable, then they are not equal as far as mathematical logic is concerned: two things are only equal if anything that is true about one has to be true about the other. In geometry, the word congruence is often preferred. Numbers are equal, geometrical objects are congruent. Two shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is. If shrinking or enlarging one of the two objects is needed, then they are not congruent. They are called similar instead. The congruence relation is often represented by the symbol \cong, while the similarity relation is represented by the symbol \sim. In computer science, usually, the mathematical definition is used. Very often, the comparison is written == (and the assignment, the act of giving a value, is written as =, or :=). In Object-oriented programming languages, or languages which have pointer (Computer Science)s, there is an additional problem. Those languages contain references (which are in fact pointers). If two such references do not reference exactly the same object, then they are different and a == b will be false in this case. For this reason, many such languages have introduced another operator (in Java programming language, this method (Computer Science) is called equals). This operator compares the actual values of the objects—not where the variables that reference them point to. In social sciences, two people are equal if many of the same things are true about them. For example. two people who have the same amount of education and money, and who are of the same age usually think of each other as equals. Another name for a person who is equal to another person is a Peer group.
Erikson's stages of psychosocial development	Erikson's stages of psychosocial development is the name of a theory of psychology: Erik Erikson and his wife Joan Erikson coined the term. They found that during their lives, most people pass through eight stages of development.
Estate (law)	An estate, in common law, is the net worth of a person at any point in time alive or dead. It is the sum of a person's assets – legal rights, interests and entitlements to property of any kind – less all liability (accounting) at that time.
Ethereum	Ethereum is a system on the Internet where people can make deals. Ether is type of money which uses the Ethereum system to make sure that every person gets the right amount in every deal. Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Many people donated money to support the development of the system in what was one of the first initial coin offerings. The system came online on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins. In 2016, Ethereum split into two separate versions, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic.
Etymology	Etymology is the study of the origin and meaning of words and names. It tells us how words have changed over time, and what other languages they came from. For example, the etymology of the word etymology is from the Greek language words ἔτυμον (étymon, "true meaning", from etymos "true") and λόγος (lógos, "word" or "study").
Euclidean distance	In Euclidean geometry, the Euclidean distance is the usual distance between two Point (geometry) p and q. This distance is measured as a line segment. The Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate this distance.
Euclidean geometry	Euclidean geometry is a system in mathematics. People think Euclid was the first person who described it; therefore, it bears his name. He first described it in his textbook Euclid's Elements. The book was the first systematic discussion of geometry as it was known at the time. In the book, Euclid first assumes a few axioms. These form the base for later work. They are intuitively clear. Starting from those axioms, other theorems can be . In the 19th century other forms of geometry were found. These are non-Euclidean geometry. Carl Friedrich Gauss, János Bolyai, and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky were some people that developed such geometries. Very often, these do not use the parallel (geometry) postulate, but the other four axioms.
Euclidean space	Euclidean space is the space Euclidean geometry uses. In essence, it is described in Euclid of Alexandria Euclid's Elements. The Plane (geometry) (\mathbb^2) and 3D (\mathbb^3) are part of Euclidean space, which can be generalized to any dimension n (in which case one writes \mathbb^n). Euclidian space is sometimes called Cartesian space. A few other spaces and mathematical objects that are similar were added later. Euclid based his work Elements on certain axioms. Euclidean space can be described using such axioms.
Euthanasia Coaster	The Euthanasia Coaster is an art concept. The idea was a Roller coaster#Types of roller coasters designed to Death its passengers. In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas. Urbonas used to work in an amusement park. Urbonas said that the goal of his proposed roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria". Urbonas said it would be like "euthanasia" or "execution". John Allen, who was the president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, gave Urbonas the idea. Allen wanted an "ultimate" roller coaster that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead". Urbonas took Allen's idea and designed the roller coaster. Urbonas said the roller coaster would make its passengers unconscious before killing them. It was criticized by the anti-euthanasia association Care Not Killing. The roller coaster kills its passengers by drastically decreasing oxygen in their brains.
Evapotranspiration	Evapotranspiration is the movement of water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation is the movement of water to the air from the ground or bodies of water (such as lakes). Transpiration is a process that happens in plants, in which water is lost through stomata in the leaves and becomes vapour in the air. Together, these form an important process in the water cycle.
Event-driven programming	In computer programming, event-driven programming also known as event-based programming is a programming method in which the Computer program is determined by sensor outputs or user actions (such as computer mouse clicks, key presses) or by Message (computer science) from other computer program or Thread (computer science) running on the computer. Event-driven programs can be written using any of the Programming language, although the task is easier in languages that provide Abstraction (computer science)s to support it. Some integrated development environments provide all assisting methods that automate most tasks required for events handling.
Everyday (video)	Noah Takes a Photo of Himself Every Day for 6 Years (as it is called on YouTube), or Everyday (as it is called on the title card), is a viral video made by Noah Kalina, a photographer from New York. Thousands of Selfie over six years are shown fast in time order.
Everything as a service	Everything as a service(EaaS, XaaS, *aaS) is a concept of being able to call up re-usable, fine-grained software components across a network. It is a subset of cloud computing. The most common and successful example is software as a service (SaaS), but the Technical terminology as a service has been associated and used with many core components of cloud computing including Communication as a service, Infrastructure as a service, Data as a service and Platform as a service. A number of vendors including Google, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Amido have been associated with the "everything as a service" trend.
Evidence	Evidence is something that is used to support an argument. It gives examples of why something is truth. For example, if someone come across a cup of spilled milk, that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If hairs of a cat and paw were found on the ground, they could be evidence that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk. If a witness saw the cat spilling the milk, her testimony would also be evidence.
Ex post facto law	An ex post facto law (Latin for "after the fact" or "from after the action") is a law that changes the legal s (or status) of actions that were ted before the law went into effect. In criminal law, an ex post facto law may Criminalization actions that were legal at the time they were committed, or may make a crime worse by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed.
Exact (company)	Exact is a Netherlands software company. The main services include Accounting software, Enterprise resource planning, and other software for small and medium enterprises. Currently, it is serving more than 500,000 companies. The main office is in Delft and others are in Europe, North America and Asia.
Excitation (magnetic)	Excitation is a process to create a magnetic field from electric current. This process is used in electric machines (Electrical generator or Electric motor) whose Rotor (electric) spins in a magnetic field. This magnetic field can come from a permanent magnet or field coils. In the case of electric machine with field coils, a current must flow to the coil to generate the magnetic field, so that the field coils can act as a "magnet", like in the case of electric machine with permanent magnet. The device in which excitation happens is called the exciter.
Executive order	An executive order or executive decree is a rule or order, or a law made by a head of state (president or monarch) who has this power given to him by the constitution of the country. The order tells ministry (government department), agency, the civil service and the military of a state the things that they must do. Executive orders can be stopped by the court in a process called judicial review. They may be stopped by the courts or the legislature if they are against laws or against the constitution. However, in countries where there is no real separation of powers and the head of state is actually a dictator, the executive order cannot be stopped by the courts or the legislature, which as a result have no powers and are controlled by him. In many cases, the head of state with dictatorial powers often rules the country by making executive orders rather than making laws in the legislature which he also controls. Executive orders have a big effect on the internal affairs of the government and on the citizen. They decide how and to what degree legislation will be enforced. They also deal with emergency and wars.
Exede	Exede Internet was launched in 2012 through ViaSat. It provides Bandwidth (computing) internet to the United States. Exede service is powered by the ViaSat-1 Satellite television. ViaSat-1 earned the Guinness World Records title for the highest capacity communications satellite. The Exede service currently serves 687,000 customers in the U.S.
Exor	Exor N.V. is a holding company whick works under the Italy Agnelli family. It is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Extinction (astronomy)	Interstellar extinction is when the electromagnetic radiation of an astronomical object is blocked and/or scattered by other astronomical objects and cosmic dust. Also known as galactic extinction when the object is in the Milky Way.
Extortion	In law, extortion is a crime. It is obtaining money, property, or service (economics) from a person or institution, through coercion. This may be by threat to a victim, to their property or family. It may also be by false (such as claiming to be a Official). Another form of extortion is offering a business owner "protection"; for example, to keep the business free from vandalism or burglary. In all states of the United States extortion is a felony.<ref name=FindLaw/> Extortion may be in person, by telephone, mail, e-mail, text message or any form of Wireless. If the extortion involves any form of interstate commerce, it may be a Federal government of the United States crime. Extortion, like robbery and blackmail, are crimes that involve obtaining property by illegal means. The most serious of the three is robbery because it usually involves violence against the victim. Blackmail is a form of extortion. The threat is usually making or Embarrassment information public if demands are not met.
Extragalactic astronomy	Extragalactic astronomy is astronomy about objects outside our Milky Way galaxy. It is the study of everything that is not covered in galactic astronomy: the study of objects in our galaxy. Because of improvements in technology, we can see distant objects in more detail. Two versions of extragalactic astronomy are: near-extragalactic astronomy (the study of galaxies in our Local Group) and far-extragalactic astronomy (the study of objects outside our Local Group). Pages on extragalactic astronomy include:
Extrajudicial killing	An extrajudicial killing (or extralegal killing) is the Murder of a person without waiting for the result of a state trial. Extrajudicial killings happen in states which either have Law favoring them, or where the state condones the killing. An example might be that someone is suspected of having done something which dishonors the family. Killing the person might be a way to keep the family in good standing (This is known as honor killing). The state might have laws that do not see this as murder, so the killers will not get a harsh sentence, or they will go unpunished altogether. If forces of the state kill someone this is seen as extrajudicial killing, if none of the following applies:
Extranet	The extranet is a part of intranet that selected people outside the company can use.
Extraterrestrial sky	In astronomy, an extraterrestrial sky is a view of outer space from the surface of a planet (or related body in space) other than Earth. The only extraterrestrial sky that has been directly observed and photographed by astronauts is that of the The Moon. The skies of Venus, Mars and Titan (moon) have been observed by space probes designed to land on the surface and send images back to Earth. Extraterrestrial skies seem to vary because of a number of reasons. An extraterrestrial atmosphere, if present, has a large bearing on visible characteristics. The atmosphere's density and chemical composition can contribute to differences in color, opacity (including haze) and the presence of clouds. Astronomical objects may also be visible and can include natural satellites, planetary rings, star systems and nebulas and other planetary system bodies. For skies that have not been directly or indirectly observed, their appearance can be simulated based on known factors, such as the position of astronomical objects relative to the surface and atmospheric composition.
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing	Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR / AIP) is considered by many therapists as a major form of psychotherapy. Francine Shapiro, Ph.D., noted that recalling or thinking about disturbing events, coupled with eye-motion; audio input or sensory input (touch, smell, taste) could aid unprocessed emotional trauma that are emotionally hurtful or painful to the body. The once painful emotional materials are un-embedded via recall of the event coupled with a sensory input which are 'metabolized' by the person's psyche from a painful and harmful state into a helpful learning experience. This processing has proven useful in helping overcome many traumatic events ranging from rape, family violence, physical or verbal abuse, first-responder shock, chronic pain, combat, hurtful memories; select health issues and unresolved, hurtful life experiences. EMDR involves the processing of painful emotional events via the recalling of the event...paired with movement of the eyes; the hearing of select sound; tactile contact; gustatory (taste) input as an input into the brains processing. This process helps the client to move-on from the physical or emotional pain they are feeling. EMDR or Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) as it is alternatively named, has been being tested and researched in a large number of organizations since it was first discovered in 1987. Like all psychological theorems and processes it has it's admiring adherents and strong critics. The EMDR has training and trainers licensed internationally and over 10,000 psychologists and therapists qualified to practice in the U.S. TREATMENT DESCRIPTION EMDR therapy combines different elements to maximize treatment effects.  A full description of the theory, sequence of treatment, and research on protocols and active mechanisms can be found in F. Shapiro (2001) Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing:  Basic principles, protocols and procedures (2nd edition) New York: Guilford Press. EMDR therapy involves attention to three time periods:  the past, present, and future.  Focus is given to past disturbing memories and related events.  Also, it is given to current situations that cause distress, and to developing the skills and attitudes needed for positive future actions.  With EMDR therapy, these items are addressed using an eight-phase treatment approach. Phase 1:  The first phase is a history-taking session(s).  The therapist assesses the client’s readiness and develops a treatment plan.  Client and therapist identify possible targets for EMDR processing.  These include distressing memories and current situations that cause emotional distress.  Other targets may include related incidents in the past.  Emphasis is placed on the development of specific skills and behaviors that will be needed by the client in future situations. Initial EMDR processing may be directed to childhood events rather than to adult onset stressors or the identified critical incident if the client had a problematic childhood.  Clients generally gain insight on their situations, the emotional distress resolves and they start to change their behaviors.  The length of treatment depends upon the number of traumas and the age of PTSD onset.  Generally, those with single event adult onset trauma can be successfully treated in under 5 hours.  Multiple trauma victims may require a longer treatment time. Phase 2:  During the second phase of treatment, the therapist ensures that the client has several different ways of handling emotional distress.  The therapist may teach the client a variety of imagery and stress reduction techniques the client can use during and between sessions. A goal of EMDR therapy is to produce rapid and effective change while the client maintains equilibrium during and between sessions. Phases 3-6:  In phases three to six, a target is identified and processed using EMDR therapy procedures.  These involve the client identifying three things: 1.  The vivid visual image related to the memory 2.  A negative belief about self 3.  Related emotions and body sensations. In addition, the client identifies a positive belief.  The therapist helps the client rate the positive belief as well as the intensity of the negative emotions.  After this, the client is instructed to focus on the image, negative thought, and body sensations while simultaneously engaging in EMDR processing using sets of bilateral stimulation.  These sets may include eye movements, taps, or tones.  The type and length of these sets is different for each client.  At this point, the EMDR client is instructed to just notice whatever spontaneously happens. After each set of stimulation, the clinician instructs the client to let his/her mind go blank and to notice whatever thought, feeling, image, memory, or sensation comes to mind.  Depending upon the client’s report, the clinician will choose the next focus of attention.  These repeated sets with directed focused attention occur numerous times throughout the session.  If the client becomes distressed or has difficulty in progressing, the therapist follows established procedures to help the client get back on track. When the client reports no distress related to the targeted memory, (s)he is asked to think of the preferred positive belief that was identified at the beginning of the session.  At this time, the client may adjust the positive belief if necessary, and then focus on it during the next set of distressing events. Phase 7:  In phase seven, closure, the therapist asks the client to keep a log during the week.  The log should document any related material that may arise.  It serves to remind the client of the self-calming activities that were mastered in phase two. Phase 8:  The next session begins with phase eight.  Phase eight consists of examining the progress made thus far.  The EMDR treatment processes all related historical events, current incidents that elicit distress, and future events that will require different responses.
FATCA agreement between Canada and the United States	The FACTA agreement is an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows the United States to exercise financial control over American citizens and other US persons who are resident in Canada. According to this agreement the Canadian tax authorities provide very detailed financial information regarding such people to the American tax authorities. FATCA was intended to catch tax-cheats, but ended up affecting all Americans living outside of the United States. There are about one million Americans living in Canada. FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) was enacted in 2010, under the Obama administration. The agreement with Canada was concluded in February 2014 when Stephen Harper was Prime Minister of Canada. Americans include, for the purpose of this agreement, "accidental Americans", their non-American families and business partners, and former non-American residents of the United States. Many other countries have signed similar FATCA agreements with the United States. These agreements affect all US persons residing in those countries. FATCA requires US persons to report to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) the balances of all bank accounts they hold outside of the United States every year. This is done through special forms which all US persons must file in addition to the other tax forms which such people must file every year even if they do not reside in the United States.The CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) collects this information from all Canadian banks and transfers this information to the United States.
FTP	FTP, also known as File Transfer Protocol, is a communication protocol for the rapid, simple transmission of Computer file across a Computer network supporting the TCP/IP. This network is generally the Internet, or a local network. FTP is a way of accessing files on another computer. FTP uses the Client-Server architecture, meaning that there is a server, that holds the files, and does the authentication, and a client, or the end-user, who is accessing the files. The server listens on the network for connection requests from other computers. The client can make a connection to the FTP server by using FTP client software. Once connected and authenticated (via rsh or SFTP) the client can do things such as uploading files to the server, downloading files (taking the server's files and putting them on his own computer) from the server, and renaming, deleting files on the server, changing file permissions, etc. Most modern Operating Systems support FTP. This implies that any computer connected to a TCP/IP based network can manipulate files on another computer on that network regardless of which operating systems are involved, provided that they are open to FTP connections. There are many existing FTP client and server programs, many of these are available free, or open source. FTP connection is also seen in Mobile phone when trying to transfer or receive data from a computer nearby.
Factoring (finance)	Factoring is selling rights to the future payments. People and companies that are receiving money from contracts every some time may be in need of extra money - so they sell rights to receive those payments for cash hence Factoring. This is done especially in construction business where companies are paid for parts of work completed instead of upfront payment. Such a company will sell future payments for small percentage fee and will receive all money they need to continue the work without delays. The structured settlement factoring transaction can be really helpful for business in financial needs.It provides business with better financing and more funds on hands in exchange for small percentage of total sum. Some banks are entering field of Factoring trying to provide same service advertised by well known names.
Fallingwater	Fallingwater is the name of the summer house Frank Lloyd Wright designed in 1935 for the Kaufmann family. It is in the woods over a waterfall in Pennsylvania. It is a nationally listed national historic place, The house actually sits low in the valley over the stream, but looks dramatic from further downstream. It has large terraces, and some of them stick straight out and hang right over the waterfall or the stream. There are windows and glass doors, with only narrow steel supports between them, wrapping all the way around the living room. There are also windows going all the way from the floor to the ceiling in all three stories of the tower. Most of the house is made from stone. There are strong horizontal and vertical lines in the design of the house. It resembles the horizontal and vertical lines in the rock formations and other natural features. The waterfall can be heard everywhere in the house. Wright wanted there to be a close connection between inside and outside, and for the house itself to be natural. The large, cave-like living room has a big fireplace built on a large rock that comes up out of the floor. This was Edgar Kaufmann's favorite place to sit before the house was built. A stairway hangs down from the main floor to the stream. A glass hatchway lets people go down it from the living room. Some of the furniture is built right into the house. Many shelves are attached directly into the wall, sticking out without any supports that can be seen, like the floors and terraces of the house itself. There is a guest house on the hill behind the main house. It is connected by an "S" shaped, covered walk. There is a plunge pool beside the guest house. In 1991, members of the American Institute of Architects named the Fallingwater house the "best all-time work of American architecture".
False confession	In law, a confession is when somebody admits that he or she has committed a crime or a felony, which is punishable. In a false confession, the person admits he or she has committed a crime or a felony, but this is not true. False confessions occur regularly. In general, there are three reasons, why they occur:
False consensus	False consensus or the effect of the false consensus is the tendency for people to assume that everyone else thinks the same way they do. It is a cognitive bias in which a person overestimates the "agreement grade" that the other people have with them. In other words, people tend to think that others agree with them. Most of the time, a person thinks that their own attitudes, beliefs, values and habits are the most common ones. In reality, the person's thoughts may not be shared by others. Another effect which can occur with false consensus is called Plural ignorance. In pluralistic ignorance, people support a norm or a belief in public, even though they really think it is wrong.
Famine	Famine is a situation where most people do not have enough food to eat. Without food, the human body grows weaker and weaker until the person becomes very Illness or Death (see malnutrition). In poor country with much subsistence farming such as in parts of Africa and Latin America, famine can be .
Faraday cage	A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an made from material that electrical conductivity electricity. It is used to block electric fields. The Faraday cage is named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented it in 1836. An electrical field outside the cage causes electric charges in the cage's conducting material to move around and cancel the field's effect inside the cage. It protects sensitive electronic equipment from external radio frequency interference (RFI). Faraday cages are also used to enclose devices that produce RFI, such as radio transmitters, to prevent their radio waves from interfering with other nearby equipment. They are also used to protect people and equipment against actual electric currents such as lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges. The enclosing cage conducts current round the outside of the enclosed space and none passes though the inside space.
Faraday's laws of electrolysis	Faraday's laws of electrolysis are a set of scientific laws used in chemistry. They are used to express magnitudes of Electrolysis. They were first described by Michael Faraday in 1834. The first law states that the mass of a Chemical substance produced by electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of the electricity that passes through the Electrolytic cell. The second law says: since Q, F, and z are constants, the larger the value of M/z (equivalent weight) the larger m will be.
Farming	Farming is growing crops and keeping animals for food and raw materials. Farming is a part of agriculture. Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution as people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities. Agriculture and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent (the Nile Valley, the Levant and Mesopotamia). The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land. This population growth to such large numbers as they are today.
Fauna	Fauna means animal life. It is a group term; it means the animal life typical of the time or place. It is a similar term to flora in Botany. So one might speak of the Eocene fauna as being different from the Miocene fauna. Or say, the fauna of a particular habitat. The flora and fauna of a savannah differ from those of a rain forest. Another use of the word is for published lists of animals, such as:
FeedDemon	FeedDemon is a free proprietary software for Microsoft Windows that reads RSS feeds. The inventor of FeedDemon is Nick Bradbury, the inventor of other software. This software is owned by NewsGator Technologies since May 2005. This software can work with Bloglines and NewsGator Online.
Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy	Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy is a book written by David D. Burns. It was published in 1980. This book made cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) popular.
Feistel cipher	In cryptography, a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers, named after the German IBM cryptographer [[:en:Horst_Feistel|Horst Feistel]]; it is also commonly known as a Feistel network. A large set of block ciphers use the scheme, including the Data Encryption Standard The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved. Feistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier. Feistel networks and similar constructions are product ciphers, and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations, such as:
Fernsehturm	The Fernsehturm () is the tallest television tower in central Berlin, Germany at and the fourth highest television tower in Europe. It is located in the park at the television tower in Berlin's Mitte (locality) Boroughs of Berlin (Bezirk). When it was completed in 1969, it was the second highest television tower in the world. In 2021, it is one of the 10 most popular attractions in Germany with over one million visitors annually. The international-style television tower was built in 1965-1969 by Deutsche Post in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in the park next to the demolished Marienviertel. On October 3, 1969, the opening took place. The building is over 220 meters higher than the old Berlin radio tower from the 1920s in the western part of the city. As a landmark visible from far away, it shapes the skyline of the city. In opening scenes of movies related to Berlin, the capital next to buildings such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Siegessäule and the Reichstag (building) building is often symbolized by the television tower.
Ferroelectricity	Ferroelectricity is a something some materials, usually crystals, do. Ferroelectricity is when a thing has a positive electric charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end, and these charges can switch places if the thing is placed in an electric field.
Fertilizer	A fertilizer is a chemical that helps plants to grow. It is used to replace the mineral salts taken by plants or removed/washed away by rain. Common fertilizers:
Figure of speech	A figure of speech is an indirect way of communicating an idea. Many figures of speech are not meant to be understood exactly as they are said: they are not literal, factual statements. They use indirect language, and mean something different from ordinary language. Linguists call these figures of speech "tropes"—a play on words, using words in a way that is different from its accepted literal or normal form. DiYanni wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different figures of speech, expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense". Metaphors are very common examples. A common figure of speech is to say that someone "threw down the gauntlet". This does not mean that a person threw a protective wrist-covering down on the ground. Instead, it usually means that the person issued a public challenge to another person (or many persons). There is no one easy way to distinguish plain speech from figures of speech.
File extension	A file extension or filename extension is a suffix at the end of a filename. It is used to show the type of a computer file. This suggests what Computer program can understand it. For example, MYWORDS.TXT is a plain text file and may be opened by a text editor. Filename extensions come after the name of the file, and many of them are three letters long. Some examples of common file extensions are:
File hosting service	A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores Computer file for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet computer, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers. A variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files. This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet.
File sharing	File sharing is the practice of making files available for other users to download over the Internet and smaller computer networks. Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where the files are stored on personal computers of the users. In this model, most people who are sharing files are also downloading files that other users share.
FileZilla	FileZilla is a free Open Source FTP program. The program is designed for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. FileZilla was the project of the month on SourceForge for November, 2003.
Filter (internet)	A filter is a website feature that removes some kinds of content. This can be to stop the user viewing the unwanted content. It can also be to stop the user posting content the site does not want. Internet filters most often work by stopping certain words being used. Filters to stop other content, such as certain kinds of pictures, can also be used. A filter can be used to only stop a certain kind of user seeing the content, children for example.
Filter feeder	Filter feeders are animals that feed on matter and food particles from water. Some animals that do this are clams, krill, sponges, baleen whales and many fish such as sharks. Some birds such as flamingos are also filter feeders. Filter feeders can help clear water.
Final Cut Pro X	Final Cut Pro X (Final Cut Pro 10) is a video editing software developed by Apple Inc. that was Announced on April 12, 2011. It is an updated version of the non-liner editing software Final cut Pro 7. It was released on June 21, 2011 for sale in the Mac App Store and is the controversial successor to Final Cut Pro
Finance	Finance is a study which figures out how people, businesses and groups make and use money. It can mean:
Financial District	The Financial District of Lower Manhattan is a List of Manhattan neighborhoods located on the southern part of Manhattan island in New York City. NY was created here in 1624.
Financial Services Authority	The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is a group who regulate banks and other Finance companies in the United Kingdom. Its Board of directors is appointed by the HM Treasury and the organisation is structured as a company limited by guarantee and owned by the UK government. Its main office is based in Canary Wharf, London, with another office in Edinburgh. When acting as the competent authority for listing of shares on a stock exchange, it is referred to as the UK Listing Authority (UKLA). The FSA's Chairman and CEO are Lord Turner of Ecchinswell and Hector Sants. On June 16, 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to abolish the FSA and separate its responsibilities between a number of new agencies and the Bank of England.
Financial Stability Board	The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. It was established after the 2009 G20 London summit in April 2009 as a successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The Board includes all G20 major economies, FSF members, and the European Commission. Hosted and funded by the Bank for International Settlements, the board is based in London, United Kingdom. Members include:
Financial capital	Financial capital is a form of capital (economics). It is things that have value, but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, money is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value. Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people. Some forms of financial capital, such as stocks, gold or bond (finance)s are not wanted by everybody. However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital. Because of this, these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price. This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market. Some things are treated as financial capital, even though they do have a use. For example, some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it. Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money. Other types of capital, such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital. This may be because they involve people. Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification. In politics, a common question is how often the government should use financial capital. In particular, should the government use financial capital to make a profit? Traditionally, liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit, but socialist or conservatism politicians are against it.
Financial market	A financial market is a market (economics) in which people trade different assets at low transaction costs. Some of these include stocks and Bond (finance), natural materials and precious metals, which are known sometimes as commodity. The word "market" is sometimes used for what is more like exchanges (trading) of stuff, and groups that help the trade in financial commodities, for example a stock exchange or commodities exchange. This can be a real on land location (such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE)) or an online electric system such as NASDAQ.
Financial regulation	Financial regulation is supervision of financial institutions to certain rules and guidelines. The aim is to keep the financial system honest and legal. Regulation may be done by either a government or quango. Also, financial regulation has increased the variety of financial products available. In the early modern period, the Dutch were the pioneers in financial regulation. The first recorded regulation was a ban on short selling done by the Dutch authorities in 1610.
Financial technology	Financial technologies (FinTech) are Technology which people use in Finance services to help companies manage the financial aspects of their business. Nowadays fintech is the basis for all online transactions - money transfers, Loan and more. Many technology Startup company and large organizations that try to improve financial services are considered to be a part of fintech. FinTech refers to new applications, processes, products or business models in the field of financial services that are provided through the Internet. Services may be provided by different independent providers at the same time. Usually it includes at least one licensed bank or insurance company. Their interaction is often regulated by special laws and regulations, such as the European Payment Services Directive. FinTech companies are special because of the ability to create innovations.
Firewall (networking)	In terms of computer security, a firewall is a piece of software. This software monitors the network traffic between the inside and outside. The firewall is placed between the network that is to be protected (trusted) and the outside network (less trusted) aka WAN or Internet. A firewall has a set of rules which are applied to each packet (computing). The rules decide if a packet can pass, or whether it is discarded.When a large network needs to be protected, the firewall software often runs on a computer that does nothing else. A firewall protects one part of the network against unauthorized access.
First language	A first language (also mother language, mother tongue, native language, arterial language, or L1) often means the language that a person learns first. It helps one understand words and concepts in the style of that language. Sometimes, but not often, first language means the language that a person speaks best (the second language is then spoken less well than the first language, etc.). In that sense, a person could have more than one first or second language.
Fixppo	Fixppo is an (iOS System Recovery) PC software tool. It is a PC software developed by iMyFone. It helps to repair iOS, iPadOS, tvOS issues. Fixppo is available on both Windows and Mac systems including the free and paid versions.
Flame test	A flame test is a test for chemicals. Normally it is used to see whether there are certain metals in a chemical compound. The chemical compound is heated in a flame and a colored flame is made. The colored flame can be turned into its spectrum to it. Many metals produce flame colors. The colors are made by electrons jumping up to higher orbits in the atom when it is heated. They fall down soon, putting out light as energy. <gallery>File:Flame Test K.jpg|Flame test for potassiumFile:Flame Test Ca.jpg|Flame test for calciumFile:Zinc flame test 2.jpg|Flame test for zinc oxide on a kitchen stoveFile:Flametest--Na.swn.jpg|Flame test for sodium.

Flash point	The flash point of a volatility (chemistry) substance is the lowest temperature at which it can become vapor, mix with air, and burn. The flash point describes liquid fuel. It helps to tell about the danger of fire from liquids. “Flash point” can describe both Flammability liquids and Combustion liquids.
Flashback	A flashback is a Skill used by writers which is often used in movies, television and literature. It involves a Fictional character remembering something that happened to him in the past. Scrubs (TV series) is a television programme that uses flashbacks often. The term is also used colloquialism, to describe lingering effects of a drug (such as lysergic acid diethylamide), or memories of a bad experience triggered by things in the present.
Flatland	Flatland is a novella by Edwin Abbott Abbott. It is set in a fictional two-dimensional world. The books is a satire on society in the Victorian era. It also looks at dimensions.
Flexagon	In geometry, a flexagon is a flat model, usually made by folding a piece of paper, so that when 'flexed' (), one or more hidden faces will be revealed (shown) from within the model. Flexagons are usually square or rectangle (tetraflexagons) or hexagonal (hexaflexagons). A prefix can be added to the name to show the number of faces that the model can display, including the two faces (back and front) that are visible before flexing. For example, a hexaflexagon with a total of six faces is called a hexahexaflexagon.
Flight number	A flight number, when combined with the name of the airline and the date, identifies a particular flight. This callsign should not be confused with the aircraft registration of the aircraft, although both can be used as a call-sign as used in general aviation. A particular aircraft may fly several different flights in one day, and different aircraft may be used for the same flight number on successive days. Sometimes when an airplane has an accident, the airline will retire the flight number and replace it with a new number.
Flight recorder	A flight recorder is a recorder placed in an aircraft to help with investigating an aircraft accident or incident. For this reason, they have to be capable of surviving extremely rough treatment. They are usually built to withstand an impact of 3600 g-force and temperatures of over 1,000 °C (as required by EUROCAE ED-112), because a powerful impact followed by a very hot fire is what often happens in a plane crash. There are two types of protected Flight Recorder, Flight Data storage device (FDR) and Cockpit voice recorder (CVR). In some cases, the two recorders may be combined in a single FDR/CVR unit. The first combined flight recorder was invented by Australian scientist, David Warren. These recorders are often called "black boxes". They can be used in other vehicles including trains and cars. The car's recorder can monitor the speed of the car or the sharpness of turns. The train's recorder can be used to upgrade after a crash to reduce the chance of another crash.
Floor plan	A floor plan (floorplan) in architecture and building engineering is a diagram, usually to Scale (ratio), of the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure. Similar to a map the orientation of the view is downward from above.
Flora	In botany, flora (plural: floras or florae) has two meanings. The first meaning refers Flowers ,Flower Goddess and plant life in an area or time period (especially the naturally occurring or indigenous plant life). The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. The second meaning refers to a book or other work which describes the plant species in an area or time period, with the aim of allowing identification. The term flora comes from the Latin language. Flora (goddess) was the goddess of flowers in Roman mythology. Plants are grouped into floras based on region, period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be geographically distinct habitats like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of an historic era as in fossil flora. Bacterial organisms are sometimes included in a flora http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/nofra.../zy198.htm#F . Other times, the terms bacterial flora and plant flora are used separately.
Flotation	Flotation is a process where gas bubbles are injected at the bottom of a tank containing a mixture of a liquid and solid particles to separate the solid particles from the liquid. When the gas bubbles move along the liquid mixture, the solids particles stick to the surface of the bubbles. The bubbles form a foam at the surface of the liquid: this foam contains the solid particles, so after the flotation process the solids can be removed just cleaning the liquid from this foam.
Flow (psychology)	Flow is a term used in psychology to mean the mental state of a person completely immersed in an activity. It is an altered state of consciousness. The person is fully focused, performing actively and successfully. The situation is widely recognized by phrases like in the zone, in the bubble, on the ball, in the moment, wired in, in the groove. The performer almost loses touch with their surroundings: phrases like "lost to the world" reflect this mental absorption. The term flow was given to this experience by a psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He said it was completely focused motivation. The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous Happiness, even rapture, while performing a task. Flow is also described as a deep focus on nothing but the activity – not even oneself or one's emotions. A flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for intrinsic purposes. Intrinsic purposes involve anything that someone does merely because they want to. Extrinsic activities will not cause flow to occur. Extrinsic activities are anything that someone does because there is some other force causing them to do it. Extrinsic activities will not cause flow to occur. Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state. While the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity.
Fluoridation	Fluoridation is the adding of fluorine compounds (fluorides) to various substances, especially toothpaste and drinking water. Government officials, scientists, and doctors say that Fluoridation helps prevent tooth decay and cavities, but it also has harmful effects in larger doses, creating a controversy over whether water should be fluoridated.
Flyby (spaceflight)	When talking about spaceflight, a flyby is when a spacecraft passes close to another object, and takes some Measurement, or Picture. Sometimes, the spacecraft uses the other object to gain speed or to change direction, in an operation called gravity assist. Spacecraft that are specially designed for this task are known as flyby spacecraft. Important parameters of a flyby are the time and the distance of the closest approach. Flyby maneuvers can be done with a planet, a natural satellite or a non-planetary object such as a Small solar system body. Planetary flybys have occurred with Mars or Earth amongst others.
Flying Spaghetti Monster	The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the god of Pastafarianism. It is often seen as a parody religion and thus has become popular with people opposed to the idea that God or gods created the world. Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are sometimes called Pastafarians. The multiverse theory has suggested that what began as a spoof has become potentially real in the infinite universes and their countless creatures with at least some matching the general description of the FSM. Bobby Henderson first described the Flying Spaghetti Monster in 2005 in a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education. Henderson wrote the letter to protest rules about teaching intelligent design in public schools. The Board of Education required teachers to teach intelligent design. The Church's website (spaghettimonster.org) contains several sighting of 'His Noodlieness', multiple propaganda resources and an ordination package available for $49. This package contains a paper certificate of ordination, a black/silverresin wallet card and two vinyl car decals. The package also comes with free shipping. As the church states, 'Great. Consider yourself a member. You’ll notice there’s no hoops to jump through. You don’t need to pay anything.'
Flyover	A flyover is something people do with fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. It means flying over people who are watching. Sometimes the airplanes fly very low to make it more exciting. The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at events. Sometimes military aircraft fly over the enemy to try to scare the people they are fighting against.
Folder (computing)	When talking about file systems, a folder (also called directory, or catalog) is a way to organize computer files. A folder is a storage space, or container, where many files can be placed into groups and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders. For many computer software applications, there is a current working directory. This is the folder that the application runs in. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file. Folders can be put together to make a filesystem and are laid out like a tree. The folders inside folders are like branches and sub-branches off the tree trunk. This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders. A computer file, such as a spreadsheet or music file can only be in one folder directly. This folder, however, can be inside other folders. On some operating systems, shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one file or folder is contained in two different parent folders. On Unix systems, this is called a symbolic link, and is similar in function to a hyperlink. Folders are inspired by a real-life item called a file folder.
Folio	When talking about manuscripts, and printing in general, a folio is a sheet, which is used on both sides. One of the sides is known as recto, the other one as verso.
Folk punk	Folk punk (also known as rogue folk) is a combination of folk music and punk rock. It became popular in the early 1980s by The Pogues in Britain, and by Violent Femmes in the United States. Folk punk got some mainstream success in the 1980s. In more recent years, its subgenres Celtic punk and Gypsy punk have gotten some commercial success.
Fomalhaut b	Formalhaut b is an object in the vicinity of the star Formalhaut, about 25 light years away. The object was first postulated in 2008. In 2012, it could be observed for the first time. The nature of the object is unknown. While it was first thought to be an Extrasolar planet, the opinion in 2021 is that it might be a dust cloud.
Food chain	A food chain shows the feeding relationship between different organisms in a particular environment and/or habitat. Plants are at the bottom of a food chain because they are producers that make their food from a process called photosynthesis . Organisms that can make their own food are called producers. Consumers are animals that eat the products of producers or other animals. The animal that eats the producer is called the primary consumer and it gains the most amount of energy. The animal that eats the primary consumer is called a secondary consumer which in the primary consumer's energy which is transferred becomes lower due to the primary consumer consuming some energy. The animal that eats the secondary consumer is called a tertiary consumer and so on to fourth, fifth, etc. The direction of arrows between the organisms shows who eats what and what gets eaten by what. A food chain also represents a series of events and consumption in which food and energy are consumed from one organism in an ecosystem to another. Food chains show how energy is passed from the sun to producers, from producers to consumers, and from consumers to decomposes such as fungi. They also show how animals depend on other organisms for food. In any ecosystem, many food chains overlap. Different food chains may include some of the same organisms. Several consumers may eat the same kind of plant or animal for food. When this happens, the food chain forms a food web. A food web shows how food chains are related within an ecosystem and how the cycles balanced between an equilibrium
Food coloring	A food coloring is any substance that is added to food or drink to change its color. Food coloring is used both in Commerce food production and in cooking at home.
Food web	A food web is similar to a food chain but larger. The diagram combines many food chains into energy relationships among organisms. Food webs show how plants and animals are connected in many ways. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. A food web (or food cycle) is a natural interconnection of food chains. The two extreme categories (trophic levels) are:
Foreshadowing	Foreshadowing or guessing ahead is a Literary technique by which an author hints what is to come. It is used to avoid disappointment, and sometimes used to arouse readers.
Forgetting curve	The forgetting curve is an idea from psychology, that shows how rapidly people forget things, if they do nothing to retain them. German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered it. A related concept is the strength of memory: People with a stronger memory are able to remember things longer. Ebbinghaus tested how long he could remember random Syllable, and recorded the results in his paper Über das Gedächtnis (1885). In 1913, this was translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology". Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as "WID" and "ZOF" (CVCs or Consonant–Vowel–Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the "forgetting curve". As a rough guide, after 20 minutes, people can only recall about 60% of what they memorized. After a week, only about 15% is left. When Ebbinghaus did the experiment, he used meaningless sequences of syllables. In the 20th century, several other researchers repeated the experiment. One of them was Georg Elias Müller. For this reason, the results are still considered to be valid. To be able to remember things better, more repetitions are needed. Things that are needed and used more often, will not be forgotten so easily.
Fork (software development)	In software engineering, a project fork happens when a copy of source code from one Computer software is made into a different piece of software. Forking is not only creating a new branch from the old software, but also a split in support between the old and new software. Free and open-source software is code that may be forked from the original Software development team without prior permission. This does not violate copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g. Unix) also happen.
Form	Form (Latin forma English language mould), refers to the external three-dimensional outline, appearance or configuration of some thing - in contrast to the matter or content or substance of which it is mainly composed (compare with shape).
Foster care	Foster care is a term used to describe when a child is living and looked after by a family which is not their own. The child may be put into foster care because their own parents are not able to look after them. When it comes to making sure that your foster child feels welcomed into their new home, you would need to do more than just open the front door for them. Welcoming a foster child into your home is like a balancing act. There may be several reasons why this may happen. The parents may be very ill or unable to control their own lives, perhaps because of alcoholism or drug addiction. They may be in prison or the children may be threatened with violence in their own home. Children are put into foster care so that they are safe and can live a more normal life in someone else's home. When a child is fostered there has to be a legal agreement. The person who looks after them instead of their own parents is called a “foster parent”. The child is made a “ward” of court, which means that power is given through the court of law to the foster parent to look after them. The foster parent(s) is “in loco parentis”, meaning: “in the place of the parent”. They can make decisions about the child because the real parent(s) are not able to do this. The laws about fostering children are, of course, not the same in different countries around the world. In most Western countries fostering can sometimes be a long-term arrangement, perhaps until the child has become an adult. However, in many cases the child may be able to return to their own family later if their family life has changed. Foster parents are paid by the state to look after the children. Adoption is different from foster care. Adoption is taking into one's family (a child of other parents), especially by a formal legal act. Fosterage is not the same as foster care. Some societies have arrangements whereby children are brought up in other families. This is a social matter, not a legal matter. This can be described as "fosterage".
Four temperaments	Four temperaments is a theory of psychology about personality. It suggests that four bodily fluids affect human personality trait theory and behaviour. The temperaments are sanguine, choleric, melancholy, and phlegmatic.
Fractional distillation	Fractional distillation is a process of separating a mixture of chemical compounds. This means that each part (called a "fraction") of the mixture can be kept apart from the other chemicals. Different chemicals have different boiling points. Fractional distillation is done by heating the mixture so that it evaporation and then each fraction condensation in its own separate compartment. The reason we don't use Distillation#Simple distillation is because for liquids that boil at less than 25°C from each other, some of the other liquid(s) may Evaporation and so part of the separated liquid may have part of the other liquid(s). It is a special type of distillation. Generally, the component parts boil at less than 25°C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere (atm). If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25°C, a Distillation#Simple distillation is used. Fractionation is done by boiling a mixture in a fractionating column. The mixture evaporates at different times and is caught in a container as a pure compound. Fractional distillation is the main activity of Oil refinery, and is done in a large fractionating column known as a "fractionation tower". Industrially, crude oil is heated and sent up along the fractionating column that has decreasing temperatures with height and several platforms at different levels to collect the condensate. Different components of crude oil have different boiling points. High molecular weight components have higher boiling points and condense at lower portions of the column while fractions with lower boiling points rise to the top of the column to condense. The main fractions include refinery gases, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, and a residue that contains bitumen. These fractions are mainly used as fuels, although they do have other uses too. Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than those with large molecules because they are volatile, flow easily and are easily ignited
Fractionating column	A fractionating column is a device often used in chemistry to separate low-boiling point liquids from high-boiling point liquids during fractional distillation. A large outdoor fractionating column is a fractionating tower.
Free and open-source software	Free and open source software (for short: FOSS, means free software and/or open source software) is software whose source code is open and available to anyone who wishes to:
Free radical	A free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron.Free radicals are involved in the mechanisms of damage associated with disease development. The need for Antioxidant in peoples’ daily life is becoming more critical with increased exposure to free radicals. Pollution, cigarette smoke, drugs, illness and stress can increase our exposure.
Free software movement	The free software movement is a software movement which aims to improve the user's rights on software and reducing proprietary (non-free) software through the use of operating systems such as Ubuntu. The movement is generally signified through open source software such as Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, FileZilla and open source operating systems such as Linux and ReactOS. The movement is against non-free software that restricts the user's rights. Examples of non-free software include Microsoft Windows, Adobe Acrobat and UltraEdit. The word 'free' is ambiguous in English. Here, it means 'free as in freedom', not 'free as a gift'. It does not mean that the software is available at no cost. An example is, "think of free speech, not free beer."
FreeOTFE	FreeOTFE is a free software, open source, computer program used to automatically encryption and decrypt information stored on a hard disk. FreeOTFE was originally written for Microsoft Windows and was later copied to Windows Mobile (FreeOTFE4PDA). It can encrypt information using a large number algorithms including Advanced Encryption Standard (aka Rijndael), Blowfish (cipher), CAST6, MARS, RC6, Serpent and Twofish. Sarah Dean is the developer of FreeOTFE.
Freeware	Freeware is software that people may get without paying for it. In this case, "free" means "free of charge". In freeware, users might not be allowed to customize or share the software or source code with others. This leaves the author with more control than with free software.
French touch	French touch or French house was a kind of house music, which became popular in France in the mid 1990s, and spread to the rest of Europe later.
Freud's psychoanalytic theories	Sigmund Freud (6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) is considered to be the founder of the Psychodynamic theory approach to psychology. Psychodynamic Psychotherapy looks closely at the Unconscious mind drives that motivation people to act in certain ways. The role of the mind is something that Freud repeatedly talks about because he believes that the mind is responsible for both Consciousness and unconscious decisions based on drives and forces. Unconscious desires motivate people to act accordingly. The id, ego, and superego are three aspects of the mind, which Freud believes, makes up a person’s personality. “We are simply actors in the drama of our minds, pushed by desire, pulled by coincidence. Underneath the surface, our personality represent the power struggle going on deep within us” (Cash, Psychology for Dummies).
FrostWire	FrostWire is a computer program for downloading files, like music, video, etc. very much like LimeWire.
Frustration	In psychology, frustration is a common emotion way to act when things go wrong. It is a feeling of being anger and sad when something one wants or wishes for does not happen. In physics, frustration (or geometrical frustration) is a property of water molecules in ice when a freezing crystal is formed. The presence of random or conflicting atoms stop the ice from being completely frozen. It is called "water ice". [[ar:إحباط]]
Fundamental attribution error	In social-psychology, fundamental attribution error is the phenomenon where Human judge other people and themselves in a different way. The person tends to judge other people's Good and bad Behaviour as them having a good personality and the person also judges other people's bad behavior as them having a bad personality. The error comes from the fact that the person judges themselves on the context or situation and not on personality. This can lead people to assume others are bad people instead of them making a mistake. An example of this error would be if we had a person, who we will name Alice. Alice is a driver. Bob goes in front of her and Alice assumes he has bad personal Quality such as being Selfishness, being a bad driver, or being a jerk. However there are possible explanations that are related to context instead of personal qualities. Bob could have almost missed his flight, or his wife could be giving birth at the hospital. If she goes in front of someone else, she will likely make the opposite mistake and explain her behavior as situational instead of being a personal flaw. This is still the same error because it is an attribution (placement) that is wrong.
Fundraising	Fundraising is the process of raising money for Charitable organization. Charities may use these to continue providing free after school activities for children, raise money for a cure and help elders and other patients with low income. This may be achieved in many ways. Some ways include:
Furry	"Furry" is also a word for something covered in fur. A furry is a person who is interested in or creates fictional animal Fictional character who have human traits. This group of people make up the furry fandom. Furry characters (called fursonas, especially when referring to someone's personal furry characters) can walk on two legs or talking. Another word for a "furry character" is an Anthropomorphism character, which means a character which has some human features. Many different stories have furry characters. Fairy tale and mythology often have animal characters who talk or do other human things. Books, cComics, children's books, video games, and toys can have furry characters too. Some of the most popular cartoon characters are furries: Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, The Walt Disney Company Robin Hood (1973 movie), and Scooby-Doo (character). Sometimes, people draw porn of furry characters to fit their sexual interests. Quite a few people believe this represents a large part of the furry fandom, and it gains significant news attention.
Futures contract	A futures contract is an agreement between two Party (law). The Trade pays the Trade today for the promise of the commodity at a future date. Futures contracts are traded in futures exchanges. The commodities can be things such as livestock, agriculture produce, metals, energy, and financial products. Trading futures can be profitable. Instead of gaining a profit, an investor can lose the money invested.<ref name=investansw/> They could be required to pay more than they invested.<ref name=CFTC/>
GParted	GParted is a program used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying Partition (computing), and the file systems on them. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems (works with Vista System & Data partitions), reorganizing disk usage, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).
Gaia hypothesis	The Gaia hypothesis, also known as Gaia theory or Gaia principle, named after earth goddess Gaia, proposes that living organisms interact with their nonliving inorganic surroundings on Earth to self-regulate the Earth's environment, a complex system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life on the planet. The hypothesis was developed in the 1970's by James Lovelock with Lynn Margulis.
Galactic halo	A galactic halo is a roughly spherical part of a galaxy. It extends beyond the main, visible part. Several components make up the halo:
Galactic quadrant	A galactic quadrant is one of four sectors of the Milky Way galaxy. A galactic quadrant is also a fictional area in the television show Star Trek. In the television show the Milky Way Galaxy is split into four sections. These sections are the Alpha Quadrant, Beta Quadrant, Gamma Quadrant, and Delta Quadrant.
Galvanometer	A galvanometer is a type of ammeter. It is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is named after Luigi Galvani. It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording, positioning, and servomechanism equipment.
Game engine	A game engine is a tool box that carries all the necessary equipment needed to rapidly build a consistent world just like the real world. For example, in real life you would expect an apple to fall to the floor if you let it go from your hand. Game makers use game engines to apply similar rules into their games which allow consistency across their game.
Gargoyle	A Gargoyle is a grotesque statue that is attached to a building. It is carved out of stone, usually granite. It is used to get water away from the building when it rains. Gargoyles are often made to look like animals or people. The collected water comes out of their mouths. Most gargoyles were made a long time ago. People used to believe that they scared away evil spirits. Many cathedrals have gargoyles. New buildings use rain gutters instead of gargoyles to move water. There are not many gargoyles in America. Gargoyles are often confused with grotesques. They are similar, but only gargoyles get rid of rainwater through their mouths.<gallery>Image:Gargoyles (Notre-Dame de Paris - South-West).JPG|Gargoyles at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, FranceImage:Pisa.Duomo.gargoyle01.jpg|Gargoyle at the cathedral in Pisa, ItalyImage:Waterspuwer.jpg|A gargoyle in Antwerpen, BelgiumImage:Mausoleum(05).jpg|A gargoyle on the Mausoleum for Queen Loise-Marie, in Oostende, Belgium</gallery>
Garlic production in China	Garlic production in China is 80% of the world's production. As of 2016, it's the largest production of garlic in the world.
Garnishment	A garnishment is the means for collecting monetary judgments against a defendant by ordering third parties to pay money directly toward the plaintiff. Wage garnishments are a process of deducting money off employees' monetary compensation (including their salary); these types of garnishments continue until entire debts are paid and can be taken for any debt, however usual examples are:
Gaslighting	Gaslighting is a type of psychology abuse where somebody uses lies or tricks to make another person doubt their memory and mental health. Gaslighting can be anything from an abusive person insisting that the abuse never happened, to creating strange incidents to confuse the victim. The word "gaslighting" comes from the play by Patrick Hamilton, Gaslight (1938), and its movie adaptations. In those works a character uses many tricks, including turning the gas lamps lower than normal, to convince his spouse that she is crazy. Since then, the phrase has become a common expression which has also been used in clinical and research literature.
Gaston Bussière (painter)	Gaston Bussiere was a French people Symbolism (art) painter, who was born on 24 April 1862 and died 29 October 1928.
Gel electrophoresis	Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate mixtures like DNA and proteins. The separation is based on how positively or how negatively charged a molecule is, and its size. Gel electrophoresis uses a gel (like gelatin) and an electric field is put through the gel. The word electrophoresis comes from –electro, because an electric field is used, and –phoresis, which means movement.
Gender dysphoria	Gender dysphoria is a term used by psychologists and physicians. It describes people who strongly feel they are not the gender they were born with. It used to be called "gender identity disorder." It is a accompanied by Stress (biology), anxiety, and Depression (mood). It is not just a desire to change sex for some they might think exists.<ref name=PsychC/> People with Gender Dysphoria are often transgender. They take steps to help their gender dysphoria. A step they could take is to take testosterone or estrogen. Transgender women take estrogen. Transgender men take testosterone. For children, puberty blockers may be taken instead. They can also get surgery. One surgery for transgender men is removal (to get rid of) breasts. This makes the chest flat. The flat chest makes them happy because they look more like a man. Another surgery for both transgender men and transgender women is Genital Reconstruction Surgery. This means they can get a penis or a vulva. Gender dysphoria may cause many to become alone but not by choice. It often leads to avoiding or High school dropouts of school.<ref name=gdPT/> Feminine Speech and ways of acting are common in people who were born male with gender dysphoria.<ref name=gdPT/> Teenager in particular are at risk of suicide.<ref name=gdPT/> The World Health Organization (WHO) renamed Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoria in 2019. The DSM renamed it in 2013.
General American	General American (GA) is a major Accent (sociolinguistics) of American English. Within American English, General American and accents approximating it are contrasted with Southern American English, several U.S. Northeast accents, and other distinct American English#Regional differences and social group accents like African American Vernacular English.
General Data Protection Regulation	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (European Union) 2016/679) was adopted on 27 April 2016. It took effect on 25 May 2018. The regulation is approved by the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. It protects people's personal data throughout the European Union (EU). The decree also affects data exports from the EU. The GDPR is aimed at giving citizens control over their personal data. It simplifies regulations for economic relations with other countries by making the EU procedures standardised. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive of 1995. The new GDPR law doesn't need any changes in local laws within the EU. The regulation is binding. People and companies who don't comply with the GDPR law may face a fine of up to 20,000,000 euros, or up to 4% of the company's profits from the previous year, whichever number is higher.
Genetically modified food	Genetically modified food (GM food) is food which has been produced using organisms that have been genetic engineering (GM organisms). GM food contains GM organisms. Common examples include maize, soybean, cotton and rapeseed. The first genetically modified food animal approved for sale is salmon. Commercial sale of genetically modified food began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its delayed ripening tomato. Genetically modified foods include: soybean, corn, canola, rice, and cotton seed oil. The features of available and future crops include resistance to herbicides, insects, viruses, fungi, production of extra nutrients, faster growth, or some other beneficial purpose. GM livestock have also been experimentally developed. Research is being done on bacteria which would speed up making cheese. Genetically modified yeast could be used to make beer that has fewer calories.
Geo (microformat)	Geo is a microformat for marking up World Geodetic System Geographic coordinate system in XHTML. Geo allows parsing tools to extract a location. The location can then be used in another website or mapping tool. It can also input into a Global Positioning System.
Geocentrism	Geocentrism is the belief that the Earth is fixed at the centre of the Universe. Geocentrists accept that the earth is round. Before the 16th century most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. In about 150 AD the Ancient Greece astronomer, Ptolemy wrote a book to explain in great detail how the spherical Earth is surrounded by things that move in the sky. From the time of Ptolemy through to the 16th Century AD educated people who knew the earth is round almost always believed the Geocentric theory of Ptolemy. From the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.
Geodesic	In mathematics a geodesic is a curve with the shortest length between two places on a surface when considering places which are not too far. These paths on a sphere are also called great circles, such that in this case, two points are joined by two distinct geodesics. A minimal geodesic (or segment) is a particular case where the geodesic joining two distant points has the shortest length.
Geoglyph	A geoglyph is a large-scale man-made feature on the ground. Usually longer than 4 metres, it is made by placing rocks, stones, live trees, gravel, or earth. A positive geoglyph is formed by the arrangement and alignment of materials on the ground, while a negative geoglyph is formed by removing material to expose bare ground.
Geometry	Geometry is the part of mathematics that studies the size, shapes, positions and dimensions of things. We can only see or make shapes that are (2D) or solid (3D), but mathematicians (people who study math) are able to study shapes that are 4D, 5D, 6D, and so on. square (geometry), circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry.
German automobile number plates	German automobile number plates (Kfz-Kennzeichen) show the place where the automobile carrying them is registered. When a person changes their main home in Germany, or buys a new automobile, they must buy new number plates. Number plates can be bought which are valid all year round or between 2 to 11 months within any 12 months. This allows changing between summer and winter automobiles, such as a convertible and a Sedan (automobile)/saloon without having the time and money wasted for de- and re-registering.
Gesamtkunstwerk	Gesamtkunstwerk is a German word meaning "total artwork". Richard Wagner used gesamtkunstwerk in creating his operas. In the Classical era, there was more emphasis on the music in an opera. But in the Romantic era, there was more of an emphasis on personal expression. Wagner made his operas into movie-like performances.
Gestalt therapy	Gestalt therapy is a form of psychotherapy. It is a way of treating people who feel ill at ease. It is based on the idea that it is best to experience what we feel "here and now" and not keep thinking about the past or worry about the future. The goal is to help clients become aware of his or her thoughts, behaviours, experiences, and feelings and to "own" or take responsibility for them. It forms part of what is called humanistic psychology and was co-founded by Fritz Perls, Laura Perls and Paul Goodman (writer) in the 1940s-1950s. At the center of Gestalt therapy is the idea of "awareness" (knowing). The person being helped is encouraged to know his or her own feelings and behaviour, and the effect they have upon the world around them. With Gestalt therapy, the patient is helped to see that they are trying to avoid feeling emotions from the present. Once the patient realizes this, he or she can begin to get better.
Ghana National Farmers' Day	Ghana National Farmers' Day is a national holiday in the Ghana. It is an annual celebration of farmers and fishermen, celebrated on the first Friday of December.<ref name="Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture" />
Ghillie suit	A ghillie suit is a special kind of military camouflage suit used by snipers. It is made of netting, with woven threads of burlap, yute, and other fibers in to help hide the sniper's body Silhouette. Ghillie suits are heavy, usually weighing 3-10 pounds or more, and can become very hot. They also can catch on objects when used in the woods and make movement difficult. Still, they are one of the best kinds of camouflage a sniper can use. With a properly made ghillie suit that matches the terrain around him, a sniper can be almost invisibility, even to a soldier right next to him.
Gibberish	Gibberish is language that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words.
Girth	Girth is the circumference of a Cylinder object, such as a Trunk (botany). Girth is sometimes used by postal services and delivery companies as basis for pricing. For example, (for at least one delivery company), if one has a box to ship, it has three sides: length (the longest side) and height and width. The girth in this case is 2 * (height + width).
Glide (API)	Glide is a 3D graphics application programming interface made by 3dfx Interactive for their Voodoo Graphics graphics processing unit cards. It was proprietary at first, then 3dfx later made it open source. It was only designed to draw graphics, mostly geometry and texture mapping, in data formats like those used in their cards. It was popular in the late 1990s because 3Dfx 3D accelerator cards were widely used, but became obsolete because Microsoft's Direct3D got better, full OpenGL implementations from other graphics card vendors came out, and 3D hardware became more diverse.
Glyphosate	Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide used in agriculture for the control of weeds, shrubs, and grasses. One brand name it is sold as is Monsanto's Roundup. It is also used in genetically modified crops. There are many studies indicating glyphosate is dangerous for animals, including humans.
Godwin's law	Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies) is a saying made by [[:en:Mike_Godwin|Mike Godwin]] in 1990. That means that as more people talk on the Internet for a longer time, it becomes more and more likely that someone will talk about Hitler or the Nazis. In 2019, Bret Stephens demonstrated both the Streisand Effect and Godwin’s Law, by publishing a column in the New York Times, where he compared his experience on Twitter to the plight of Jews under Hitler’s regime.
Going Solo	Going Solo is a non-fiction book by Roald Dahl. It is the second part of his autobiography, and was published in 1986. Going Solo is the story of Dahl's first job, in Africa, and about how he became a Royal Air Force fighter pilot in World War II.
Golden Eagle Award	Golden Eagle Award () is a Russian national award for movies and TV series, run by the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts since 2002. It like the Academy Awards and gives out in 20 nominations each January. The ceremony is held at the Mosfilm studios, where some of the most acclaimed Soviet features were filmed.
Google Drive	Google Drive is a cloud computing created by Google. Users may store files on Google Drive so that they can store their files on the internet. Many users find it is convenient to put files on Google Drive because they won't have to worry about losing portable hard drives.You can add things using Camera,Upload,Folder,Docs,Slides,and Sheets.See you!*leaves*
Google I/O	Google I/O is a conference for Internet Software developer that happens each year, since 2008. Google uses it to talk about new web technology. Google Android, Google Chrome and Google Wave are technologies that have been shown there.
Google Maps (application)	Google Maps is a mobile application for mapping that was released by Google for Android (operating system) in 2008. An iOS version was released on December 13, 2012. The iOS version was released as an alternative to Apple Inc.'s built-in maps application, which was released with iOS 6. Google Maps has many features, including turn-by-turn navigation, street view, and public transit information. The application's user interface was completely redesigned. The original version did not support the iPad, but Google added iPad support with version 2.0.
Gopher (protocol)	Gopher is a protocol. It was designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving Document over the Internet. Gopher represented an early alternative to the World Wide Web. The gopher protocol has some things HTTP-based clients do not have. It is based on menus. An item selected from a menu will either open another menu, or a document. Because of concern over possible License fees, and the relative flexibility of the World Wide Web, the protocol did not get much use. There are less than 200 gopher servers still actively maintained. Many of the remaining gopher servers are run by individuals. Most of them are rarely updated except for the ones run by enthusiasts of the protocol. A handful of new servers are set up every year by hobbyists - over 50 have been set up and added to Floodgap's list since 1999. Today Gopher exists as an almost forgotten corner of the Internet. - one can publish email addresses in plaintext without having to worry about spam, and publish large amounts of data without the risk of the server's bandwidth becoming saturated by overuse. In the early stages of mobile Internet access, some suggested that the simple interface of Gopher would be a good match for mobile phones and Personal digital assistants (PDAs). Web-based solutions also won in the mobile space, with technologies like Wireless Markup Language (WML)/Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), DoCoMo i-mode, XHTML Basic or other adaptations of HTML and XML. Several Server are still maintained and updated for the Gopher protocol. For example, the PyGopherd Gopher server provides a built-in WML front-end to Gopher sites served with it. The Motsognir Gopher server provides PHP5 and Plugin support. Many current web-browsers have stopped supporting the gopher protocol directly, such as Mozilla Firefox. But 3rd-party addons and plugins are still available to replace browser-based Gopher functionality.
Gowling WLG	Gowling WLG is a Multinational corporation law firm. It was formed by the merger of Canada-based Gowlings and UK-based Wragge Lawrence Graham & Co in February 2016. This was the first multinational law firm merger between British and Canadian firms. Gowling WLG International Limited is an English company limited by guarantee. The two limited liability partnerships of Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP and Gowling WLG (UK) LLP are members of it. The two partnerships provide legal services. They are Finance separate. This is a fairly loose association, where each "partner" does the legal work for its own country. Therefore regulators in each country know who is responsible for any particular case.
Grain elevator	A grain elevator is a machine which carries loose grain such as wheat to higher levels. It is used to get the grain into grain silos. Before grain elevators, the grain had to be carried in sacks. In some parts of the world such as Canada, the term grain elevator means more than just the lifting machine, and includes all the grain handling buildings.
Gramme machine	A Gramme machine, Gramme ring, Gramme magneto, or Gramme dynamo is an electrical generator that makes direct current. It is named for its Belgian inventor, Zénobe Gramme. It was the first generator to make enough power for industry. Gramme showed this machine to the Academy of Sciences in Paris in 1871.
Grand jury	A grand jury is a legal body which has the power to conduct official proceedings to possible crime. They also decide whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may subpoena evidence (law) and may compel the sworn of witnesses who appear before it. Grand juries are made up of from 16 to 23 people in the United States. They meet for a period of one month up to a year. However, jurors may only have to meet for a few days each month. The juries meet in private. The suspected person, called a suspect, is not usually present. About half the States of the United States in the US do not regularly use grand juries.).
Graphical projection	A graphical projection is a protocol by which an image of a three-dimensional object is projected onto a planar surface without the help of math.
Graveyard slot	A graveyard slot is a timeslot during the early morning hours, between 2:00 to 6:00 a.m., after late night television and before morning news shows. Many Human are Sleep at home, or in work away from the television. The timeslot mainly shows reruns of original shows. Overnight news programs are broadcasted on American Broadcasting Company and CBS. NBC had its overnight news program during the 1980s.
Great Lakes	The Great Lakes are five large lakes in east-central North America. They hold 21% of the world's Surface area fresh water. The five lakes are: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.
Green manure	Typically, a green manure crop is grown for a specific period, and then plowed under and incorporated into the soil. Green manures usually perform several functions, that include soil improvement and soil protection:
Green roof	A green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or totally covered with plants. It may also include layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Container gardens on roofs, where plants are in pots, are not generally true green roofs. Although, this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another kind of green roof which are used to treat greywater. Vegetation, soil, drainage layer, roof barrier and irrigation system make up a green roof. There are reasons why a building may have a green roof. The reasons include Absorption of water Rain, providing Building insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife, increasing benevolence and decreasing stress of the people around the roof, and helping to lower urban air temperatures and go against the heat island effect. Green roofs are able to be added on old buildings as well as new buildings. They can be put on small garages or larger industrial, commercial and municipal buildings. There are two types of green roof:
Greenhouse effect	The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere (the air around the Earth) trap infrared radiation. This makes the planet become warmer, similar to the way it makes a greenhouse become warmer. The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases; the most important greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are: water vapor, carbon dioxide(CO2), and methane. When there is more greenhouse gas in the air, the air holds more heat. This is why more greenhouse gases cause climate change and global warming.<ref></ref> The greenhouse effect is natural. It is important for life on Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be around -18 or -19 degrees Celsius (0 or 1 degree Fahrenheit). Earth would be locked in an ice age. Because of the greenhouse effect, the Earth's actual average temperature is 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit). The problem is that recently, the greenhouse effect has become stronger. This is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide when they are burned. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has global warming over the past 150 years. About 10,000 years ago, before people started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, there were 260 to 280 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, but now there is over 400 ppm. Most scientists say that having 350 ppm or less is safe for the environment and that species on the planet can adapt to this level. Higher levels can make severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today, such as ocean acidification. The greenhouse effect was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824. Mars, Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects. The effect on Venus is especially strong because Venus has so much CO2. This is why Venus is hotter than Mercury (planet), even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The first person to predict that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels (and other combustion processes) could cause global warming was Svante Arrhenius.
Grime (music)	Grime is a genre of electronic music that first began in London in the early 2000s. The genre evolved out of UK garage and is influenced by drum and bass, dancehall, ragga, and hip hop. Grime music is generally produced around 137-143 Tempo, with its aggressive, jagged electronic sound. Rapping is also an important part of grime. Pirate radios (illegal radio stations) were important in the early days of grime, as they were the only places that would play the genre before it was able to gain mainstream attention in the UK during the mid-2000s. Early important musicians would be Dizzee Rascal, Kano, Lethal Bizzle, and Wiley. Other important musicians include; P Money, Ghetts, Jme, Skepta, Stormzy and grime groups such as Boy Better Know, Newham Generals, Roll Deep, and Ruff Sqwad. In the mid-2010s, grime started to gain attention in Australia. The genre has been described as the "most significant musical development within the UK for decades".
Gross indecency	Gross indecency is a law used in some English-speaking countries. It was first used to criminalize sexual intercourse between men, in 1855. Oscar Wilde was charged with gross indecency, in 1895. Alan Turing also pleaded guilty to the charge of gross indecency. If two men either have oral sex or anal sex, this is called sodomy. It is punished differently, in places where it is a crime.
Guilded	Guilded is a Voice over IP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform made and owned by Guilded, Inc. Users can talk by using Voice over IP, Videotelephony, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "guilds". Guilded runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android (operating system) and iOS. Guilded is mainly focused on competitive gaming and esports.
Guilt (law)	In criminal law, a person is guilty if a Court (law) has decided they have done something illegal. If a person has broken a law by stealing, for example, they are guilty of a crime. A person is guilty if a court says they are. The court has blamed them for doing something wrong. A guilty person is Punishment. The punishment is called the Sentence (law).
H.264/MPEG-4 AVC	H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding is a way to code videos in order to make them smaller. It can be used for both lossy compression and Data compression#Lossless compression, though it is usually used for lossy compression. H.264 is used in many places including Blu-Ray, as well as videos streamed through sites like Youtube. It is also used in some Television broadcasts. H.264 has a successor called High Efficiency Video Coding.
HCard	hCard, short for HTML vCard, is a format for publishing the contact information of people, company, organizations, and places, in XHTML, Atom, RSS, or raw XML.
HM Treasury	Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), often known as the Exchequer, or unofficially the Treasury, is the Departments of the Government of the United Kingdom that is behind the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury also operates the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), that replaced the Combined Online Information System (COINS). The possessive adjective (HM) in the name of the ministry changes depending upon the sex of the current monarchy of the United Kingdom. There are a few roles that are associated with the Treasury, such as the First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.
HTML	Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. In easier words, HTML is a kind of programming language that can make a new webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML also adds meta information to a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is data about the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while JavaScript is used for website behavior and also changing the HTML and CSS. HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are several versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is dubbed HTML5 and is specifically at version 5.2.
HTTP 404	The 404 or Not Found is an HTTP error Message (computer science) meaning the server could be contacted, but the file or webpage trying to be accessed could not be found. It happens when the URL you clicked on was moved, renamed, deleted or does not exist.
HTTP cookie	An HTTP cookie (usually just called a cookie) is a simple computer file made of text. The information stored by cookies can be used to personalise the experience when using a website. A website can use (the information used by) cookies to find out if someone has visited a website before and record information (data) about what they did. When someone is using a computer to web browser a website, a personalised cookie file can be sent from the website’s server to the person’s computer. The cookie is stored in the web browser on the person’s computer. At some time in the future, the person may browse that website again. The website can send a message to the person’s browser, asking if a cookie from the website is already stored in the browser. If a cookie is found, then the data that was stored in the cookie before can be used by the website to tell the website about the person’s previous activity. Some examples where cookies are used include Online shopping, automatic login and remembering which advertisements have already been shown. Cookies have been a problem for Internet privacy. This is because they can be used to track browsing behavior. Because of this, laws have been made in some countries to protect people's privacy. There are many other options than cookies, but each option has its own problems. Cookies have often been mistaken for computer programs. But cookies cannot do much on their own. They are simply a piece of data. They are often called spyware or computer viruses, but they are not either of these. Most web browsers allow users to choose whether to accept cookies. If the user does not allow cookies, some websites will become unusable. For example, shopping baskets which use cookies do not work if the user does not allow cookies.
Habeas corpus	A writ of (; Latin: "may you have the body") is a writ (legal action) that requires a person who has been arrested or imprisoned to be brought to a judge or into court. Once the person is brought before the court, the judge will determine if the person is being lawfully detained or must be released.
Halakha	Halakha is the Hebrew language word for the Jewish code of laws.
Half-space (geometry)	When a Cartesian coordinate system plane (Infinite 2D space) is split with a line (doesn’t matter where) the two sides will be of equal area (because the plane is infinite on each side of the line), each side is known as a half-space. This concept applies to 3-D Euclidean space aswell.
Hall church	A hall church is a type of church building. The term "hall church" is about the architecture of the building. Most very large churches and cathedrals are built with a long part where people sit, called the "nave". On each side of the nave is a lower "aisle". Between the nave and the aisles are rows of columns. Above the columns are windows which let light into the nave. In a hall church, there are no windows above the columns. The nave and the aisles are about the same height. Famous cathedrals which are hall churches are Milan Cathedral in Italy, St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and Bristol Cathedral in England. The term was first used in the mid-19th century by the German art historian Wilhelm Lübke. <gallery>Image:060823 stephansdom2a dp.jpg|Another inside view of St Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna.Image:Eglise St Thomas - Interieur - Strasbourg.jpg|Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg) is the only hall-church in Alsace.

Hallucination	A hallucination is seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or feeling things that do not really exist. Usually people have to be awake and conscious to have hallucinations. That way, a person who sees or hears something that is not really there has a hallucination. Hallucinations are different from dreams. When people dream they are not awake. Hallucinations are also different from illusions. Illusions are based on real perceptions, which are distorted or interpreted in a wrong way. Certain drugs can cause hallucinations. Some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations. Certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations. In some cases, withdrawal of a drug can also cause hallucinations. This has especially been reported by people trying to stop taking sleeping pills, or by alcoholics. People who have hallucinations are not necessarily ill, lack of sleep can also cause hallucinations. Hallucinations just before going to sleep or just after waking up are considered normal.
Haltlose personality disorder	Haltlose personality disorder is a mental illness that displays as selfishness, blaming others for the actions they have committed, lacking direction in life and a lack of insight and self-control. They are unable to learn from experience or mistakes in life since they lack any sense of past or future, It is studied in psychiatry, sociology and criminology - and is one of the most common types of psychopathy to end up committing crimes, including violence and murder. Healthier individuals may still focus on either vengeance or sadism. Parents with Haltlose make up the majority of those who sexually molest their own children. The disorder has many things in common with Anti-Social personality disorder such as histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or fantasy prone personality. Sometimes doctors will make a mistake and think it is bipolar. It can also look like epilepsy if combined with alcoholism.<ref name="arc" /> It can be very difficult for a doctor to help them become better since they tend to lie to doctors because they are afraid, and their pathological lying can be convincing even though they view it similar to a child and often believe they should be rewarded for having taken the time to invent such a good lie.<ref name="art" /> Of all the different types of psychiatric patients, those with Haltlose personality disorder have some of the worst results. The Haltlose will usually need boundaries and controls set by those around them, and "optimistic" professionals suggest that marriage to a spouse willing to curtail their behaviors may be sufficient to avoid professional involvement.<ref name="curran" /> Their symptoms get worse if they are given independence, whether at home, work or in a prison or hospital.<ref name="kramer" />
Ham sandwich theorem	The ham sandwich theorem is a math theorem that says that a number of objects in the same number of dimension can be cut into two equal parts with a cut that is one dimension less.
Hanging Houses of Cuenca	The Casas Colgadas (Hanging Houses), also known as Casas Voladas, Casas del Rey is a complex of houses located in Cuenca, Spain. Houses of this kind were frequent along the eastern border of the ancient city in the past. They hang on the cliffs over the Huécar River gorge. Today there are only a few of the houses still there. The most well known is a group of three with wooden balconies. The houses date to the 14th century. Through the years they have been refurbished a few times. The most recent took place during the 1920s. They have been used as individual homes. They have also been used as council houses. Now they are the host to a mesón, a type of restaurant, and the Museo de Arte Abstracto Español (Spanish Abstract Art Museum), in Cuenca. The Casas Colgadas were one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.
Hardiness zone	A hardiness zone is an area where some plants can grow. The zones are categories based on the average coldest temperature in a given year. Plants in that category or one with a lower number can grown in that area.
Harlem Renaissance	The Harlem Renaissance is the name for a movement in African-American culture in the 1920s and 1930s which has had a big influence on African-American literature, philosophy and music. The Harlem Renaissance is also called the "Black Literary Renaissance", '"The New Negro Movement" and "The flowering of Negro literature". The movement began in Harlem, New York after World War I. In 1925 a book was published called "The New Negro", edited by Alain LeRoy Locke . This book was a collection of writing by African-Americans which looked at their people's lives experiences since the American Civil War. From 1925 onwards, there was a movement called the "New Negro Movement", named after the book. The movement began to affect the thinking of many African-American writers and artists of all sorts. They challenged the thinking of many white Americans towards black Americans. They refused to be treated as if they were not equal. They refused to just copy the sorts of writing, art and music that white Americans did. They wanted to celebrate the fact that their African culture had survived through the terrible years of slavery, and was being "reborn". (The word "Renaissance" means "rebirth" and is generally used for a time from 1400 to 1600 in Europe.)
Harm	Harm is physical or Psychology or emotional [[:wikt:damage|damage]] or injury to a person, animal or other legal entity. It is generally believed that humans, in addition to other sentient animal species, possess an aversion to causing harm to others. Many religions consider any harm to another person a sin.
Harmonia Macrocosmica	The Harmonia Macrocosmica is a Star chart by Andreas Cellarius. It was published in 1660 by Johannes Janssonius. The first part of the atlas has copper plate prints showing the universe models of Ptolemy, Nicolaus Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. In the second part are star maps of the Christian constellations. The atlas also had plates supporting the views of the Catholic Church, so the book was not placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list of publications the Catholic Church .
Harvest	Harvest means to [[:wikt:collect|collect]] what has been planted and in the ground. It is usually done by farmers, and in the autumn season. This is also called picking crops. Crop failure (also known as harvest failure) is a loss or reduced crop yield due to plants being damaged, killed, or destroyed. Sometimes it brings famine. "Harvest" can also mean to collect other things than plants such as aquaculture bivalves including oysters, scallops, and other animals.
Hay	Hay is grass and other plants that have been cut, dried and collected. It can then be stored in (called hay stacks), or tied into blocks called bales. Bales can be round or box shaped (usually called square bales). Hay is mostly used to feed animals. Some animals that eat hay are horses, cattle, goats, donkeys, and rabbits. Hay is fed when there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which an animal can graze or they can't graze year round. Farmers and ranchers often need to use hay in the winter when grass is not available. Hay is different than straw. Hay is made from leafy grass and other plants (such as alfalfa) and is good for feeding animals. Straw comes from the stems of cereal grains, and is not very nutritious. Straw is normally used for bedding to keep animals warm and dry.
Hazard	A hazard is something that can be . Fire, Explosives and Fuel are all examples of hazards. Many chemicals can be a hazard. There are ways to get rid of hazardous things. There are different types of hazards; some can catch things on fire; some can burn skin; some can irritate the eyes, etc. The term 'hazard' is used in driving instruction, and in some traffic-related laws. It simply means 'something a motorist should notice and drive accordingly'. For example, children playing on the pavement (U.S. = sidewalk; Austr. = footpath) are a potential hazard. If any go into the actual road, then they are a real hazard, and motorist should do whatever is safe.
Heat lightning	Heat lightning is the name for lightning from thunderstorms that are far away that is not followed by thunder. This happens because the lightning is far away and the sound of the thunder stops before it reaches the person watching the thunderstorm. Although it is named heat lightning, it does not have anything to do with the heat of the lightning itself. At night, lightning can be seen from up to 100 miles away, but the thunder doesn't go that far. Heat lightning is often seen during the summer months. In Florida, heat lightning can often been seen over the water at night from thunderstorms that formed during the day.
Heavy metals	Heavy metals are metals or chemical compounds containing metals with relatively high density, high atomic weights, or atomic numbers. This might mean up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements. Mercury (element), lead and bismuth are examples. The term is widely used in science. They have a density of more than 5 g/cm3. All of them are density than iron The term is sometimes used for any toxic metal, or metalloid such as arsenic, regardless of density. The term heavy metals includes chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, silver, gold, cadmium, antimony, mercury, thallium, tungsten, platinum and lead. The heaviest metal by density is osmium. Although most heavy metals are toxic, not all of them are. For example, gold, which is one of the heaviest metals, is non-toxic and chemically inert in the body. Some gold compounds are toxic, however. More specific definitions of a heavy metal have been proposed but none is widely used. Heavy metals are scarce in the Earth's crust because most have sunk into the Earth's core. Many are used in modern life. They are used, for example, in golf clubs, cars, antiseptics, self-cleaning ovens, plastics, solar panels, mobile phones, and particle accelerators.
Hedge	A hedge or hedgerow is a close-knit row of shrubs and sometimes tree species. They were usually planted and "trained" to form a barrier. They marked the boundary of an area, and so were a sign of possession. Livestock farmers use them to prevent cattle straying out of fields. Animals which cannot usually be contained in fields (hill sheep for example) need a man and dog to look after them, which is an expense. Hedges were much more common before modern agriculture. Modern crop farming uses machines to gather the crop, and so hedges have all but disappeared in some areas. When hedges are first laid, they are usually all of one species. But over hundreds of years, the number of species in a hedge gradually increases, and often includes fully-grown trees. There are many hedges in Europe which have been there for 500 or a thousand years. Making hedges into ornaments is a skill called topiary. Sometimes, hedges are made into mazes. Hedges are vitally important to small birds and mammals. In the modern world they play the role which thick forest undergrowth would have played in an ancient ecology. The nests in a hedge or thicket often cannot be got at by larger predators. Obviously tiny birds like European robin or finches choose safe places to nest, and if they cannot, then their brood is unlikely to survive.
Hedge fund	A hedge fund is an investment. It is a way of investing money.
Hellenistic art	The art of the Hellenistic time (400 B.C. to 0 B.C, a long time in the past, in Greece) is sculpture and painting and other things. For a long time, people said that the art of that time was not good. Pliny the Elder talked about the Greek sculpture of the classical time (500 B.C. - 323 B.C., the time before the Hellenistic time) and then said Cessavit deinde ars ("then art stopped"). But much good art is from the Hellenistic time. Many people know about the sculptures Laocoön (in the picture) and Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace. Now more people have looked at writing about the Hellenistic time. People discovered art from the Hellenistic time at Vergina and other places. Now people can see that the art of the Hellenistic time is very good art.
Hello world program	A Hello world program is usually a program made by computer programmers that are new to a programming languages, or to test if the compiler for this language is working correctly. It will simply put the text Hello, World! on the screen.One way to do the Hello World program is shown below, in the C programming language.<syntaxhighlight lang="c">
Herbicide	A herbicide is a poison that kills plants. There are many kinds of herbicides, from weedkillers for gardens to Agent Orange which was used to destroy forests in the Vietnam War.
Herbivore	Herbivores are animals that only eat plants. They are herbivorous animals. Herbivores (such as deer, elephants, horses) have teeth that are adaptation to grind vegetable tissue. Many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants, for example roots and seeds. Usually, such animals cannot digestion meat. But some herbivorous animals will eat Egg (food) and occasionally other protein. Some animals are frugivores because they eat mainly fruit. Browsers eat mostly leaves and sometimes small tree branches. Animals that eat mostly grass are grazer animals. The diets of some herbivorous animals change with the seasons. In the temperate of the Earth, some seasons are hot and some are cold, so different plants are available at different times of the year. Humans are omnivores, because they eat meat as well as plants. People who eat mostly plants are usually called vegetarian or vegan.
Herding	Herding is the act of bringing individual animals together into a group (herd). It is maintaining the group and moving the group from place to place. Many thousands of years ago herding became a way of life for many nomadic people. Today it is still a necessity for farmers, ranchers and those who raise Domestication.
Heterotroph	A heterotroph (Ancient Greek heteros = another and trophe = nutrition) is an organism that requires organic compound substrates to get its carbon for growth and development.
Hex editor	A Hex editor is a piece of software that allows one to edit Binary numeral system on a computer. The name comes from the fact that such data is usually represented as hexadecimal numbers.
Hick's law	Hick's law, or the Hick–Hyman law is named after British and American psychologists W. E. Hick and Ray Hyman. It describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices. Increasing the number of choices increases the decision time logarithmically. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of informations in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information. Hick's law may support some computing menu design decisions. For example, to find a given word (e.g. the name of a command) in a randomly ordered word list (e.g. a menu). If the list is alphabetical, and the user knows the name of the command, he or she may be able to use a subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time.
High-definition video	High-definition video (HDTV Video or HD video) is video of higher display resolution and quality than Standard-definition television. While there is no standardized meaning for high-definition, generally any video image with considerably more than 480 vertical Scan line (North America) or 576 vertical lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. 480 scan lines is generally the minimum even though the majority of systems greatly pass that.
High-voltage direct current	A high-voltage direct current (HVDC) is a Electric power transmission which uses Direct current (DC) to transmit electricity. It is more efficient over long distances than the usual Alternating current (HVAC).
HighBeam Research	HighBeam Research is a business which has a search engine and fulltext online archive. It is owned by Cengage Learning (through its Gale (Cengage) subsidiary) for newspapers, magazines, academic journals, newswires, trade magazines and encyclopedias in English. It is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. HighBeam has access to over 6,556 publications. However, only fulltext access is provided. No complete issues of papers are included. The site has archives from newspapers, newswires, and arts magazines such as:
Highly sensitive person	A highly sensitive person (HSP) is very easily affected by things. They are said to have a 'high sensitivity' (or innate sensitiveness as Carl Gustav Jung originally called it). According to some researchers, highly sensitive people are about one fifth of the population. They process Senses data much more deeply and thoroughly because their nervous systems are biology different. This is a specific Trait theory with key effects that have often been confused with shyness, Inhibition, fearfulness, introversion, as well as other effects. The existence of innate sensitivity was shown using a test. The term is mainly used to describe humans, but may also describe animals.
Hijan Hirao	"Hijan Hirao" (), also spelt as "Hichan Hilao" (), is a Meitei poetry text (Puya (Meitei texts)), about the cutting down of a tree and crafting it into a boat. The poetic verse of the text is sung at the end of the religious festival of Lai Haraoba.<ref name="Hijan Hirao Text Context and Translation Book Review By James Oinam" />
Hinglish	Hinglish (हिंगलिश) is a language that combines words from the English language with those of South Asia. The name Hinglish itself is a Portmanteau word of "Hindi" and "English". It is spoken on the Indian subcontinent and the United Kingdom. It borrows words from other languages such as Punjabi language, Urdu and Hindi. Now it is spoken by about 350 million speakers.<ref name=BaldaufCSM/> It is heard on television and in advertisements in India. Coca-Cola's ad in Hinglish is "Life ho to aisi" (Life should be like this). Pepsi's ad is "Yeh Dil Maange More" (the heart wants more). Domino's Pizza asks "Hungry kya?" (Are you hungry?).<ref name=BaldaufCSM/> It has become a hybrid language many Indians speak naturally and without giving it any thought.<ref name=Econ/> The first book written in Hinglish, All we need is Love, is by Richa Devesar. It was published in March of 2015.
Historical novel	According to Encyclopædia Britannica, a historical novel is
Hiyang Hiren	Hiyang Hiren () (literally, "large race boat") is a traditional royal race boat, used at the Hiyang Tannaba ceremony in the religious festival of Lai Haraoba.The boat is regarded as invested with spiritual powers and is associated with religious rites. The Meitei people believe that the worship of the boat will bring protection from the evils.The Hiyangloi Hanchapa is responsible for making the Hiyang Hiren, which is decorated with the stern (hirubak) the head of the Sangai deer.The boat is around 54 feet long, and its racing ceremony is held annually for two days.
Hiʻiaka (moon)	Hi'iaka is a moon that orbits a dwarf planet called Hauema, which is further away from the Sun than Neptune (planet) is. Hi'iaka is named after a Hi'iaka.
Holding company	A Holding company is a company, which has the purpose of owning stock (or shares) of other companies. In most cases, such companies do not sell products or services, they manage the companies they (partly) own. Probably one of the best known holding companies was the "Standard Oil of New Jersey", founded in 1889, which is called ExxonMobil today.In general, there are three forms:
Home directory	In computer, a home directory is a special directory (File system) (or location in the File system, Apple calls directories folders). Very often, there is one such home directory per user. Some users, which were created by the system and usually do not log in, do not have such a home directory. A home directory is used to store personal files of the respective user, including written document and settings for programs.
Homograph	A homograph is one of a group of words that have the same spelling but have different meanings. They can also have different pronunciations. For example:
Homophone	Homophones are words that sound the same as another word but have a different meaning, and often a different spelling. Examples include:
Hong Kong national security law	The Hong Kong national security law is the law that is about national security in Hong Kong. The full name of the law is Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It was enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in June 2020. It is different from other laws in Hong Kong for not being enacted by the Hong Kong Legislative Council.
Hook (music)	A hook is a Motif (music) that is used in popular music to make a song appealing and to "catch the ear of the listener". It is usually a short riff, passage (music), or phrase (music). The term generally is used for popular music, especially rock music, contemporary R&B, hip hop music, electronic dance music, and pop music. In these genre, the hook is often in the refrain. A hook can be either melodic or rhythmic, and often uses the main motif (music) for a piece of music.
Horizontal	Horizontal is a direction perpendicular to the vertical. That is, it goes in all directions except up and down. The term comes from the horizon.
Horror story	A horror story is a story made to Fear people. It is like a horror movie but in a book or told by others.
Horticulture	Horticulture is the practical botany of gardens. It includes both decorative and vegetable aspects of gardens. A horticulturist is a person who works and conducts research in the science and skill of growing flowers, fruits, vegetables or ornamental plants. Plant breeding is an important part of horticulture.
Hostname	Americans hostname (also known as a sitename) is the unique name by which a network device (which may be a computer, file server, network storage device, copier, cable modem, etc.) is defined and known on a computer network. The hostname is used to identify a particular host in various electronic communication networks such as the World Wide Web, e-mail or Usenet. On the Internet, the terms "hostname" and "domain name" are often misused interchangeably, but there are small technical differences between them.
Hotspot (computers)	A hotspot is a place where computers with the ability for wireless connections can connect to the Internet. Wi-Fi hot spots can be found in some public areas, sometimes for free. Some local library, coffee shops, and restaurants offer hotspots. Some passenger vehicles have a traveling hotspot for their customers. Some communication companies also offer hotspots in many different places for their customers.
Hotsuit	Hotsuit is a fitness apparel and accessories brand. It is designed to make the wearer sweat profusely. It is intended for use in sports however, it has become commonly worn in other contexts.
Hubble Extreme Deep Field	The Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) is an image of a small part of outer space in the center of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. It is in the direction of the constellation Fornax. The image shows the deepest optics view into space.<ref name="Space-20120925"/><ref name=nasa/> The XDF image was released on September 25, 2012. The image combined 10 years of images. It shows galaxy that are over 13.2 billion years old. The exposure time was two million seconds, or about 23 days. The least bright galaxies are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see. Many of the smaller galaxies are very young galaxies. Some of there became the major galaxies, like the Milky Way and other galaxies in our galactic neighborhood.<ref name=nasa/> The Hubble eXtreme Deep Field adds another 5,500 galaxies to Hubble's 2003 and 2004 view into a very small part of the farthest universe.
Human nature	Human nature refers to the characteristics of human race. This means ways of thought, emotion and behaviour which humans have naturally. What these characteristics are, what causes them and how fixed human nature is, are good questions. They among the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy. These questions affect ethics, politics and theology. Human nature is a source of advice on how to live well, but it also puts limits and on living a good life. The complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature, while the humanities inquire into human nature, and what it means to be human.<ref name=Human/>
Human powered aircraft	A human powered aircraft is an aircraft that is powered entirely or partly by the pilot(s). Several human powered aircraft have been constructed in the past 30 years for recreation or to win prizes. Designing a successful human-powered aircraft is difficult because a very large power to weight ratio must be d. This has been the reason why many of these aircraft use composite materials in their construction. There are human-powered aircraft being designed and made now. One aircraft is being built by Virginia Tech University named the Iron Butterfly. Another one is being built by the Pennsylvania State University named the Zephyrus.
Humus	Humus (or humous) is the organic matter in the soil. It is made of decomposition parts of plants and animals. Humus takes in water and has plenty of nutrients. Nitrogen is the most important. Plants put roots into the soil to get the water and nutrients. Humus is good for plants because it is like a sponge. The dark colour of humus (usually black or dark brown) helps to warm up cold soils in the spring (season).
Hydration	Hydration is the adding of water molecules to a chemical substance. The anhydrous (without water) form and the hydrated (with water) form can be quite different. The hydrated form is called a "hydrate". For example, anhydrous tin(IV) chloride is a liquid, while the pentahydrate (with 5 water molecules) is a solid. Anhydrous copper sulfate is white or light green, while the hydrated form is blue. Anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride is blue, while the hydrated form is red. Anhydrous copper(II) chloride is brown, while the dihydrate is green. The number of water molecules for each atom is given by a prefix. Mono- means 1, di- means 2, tri- means 3, tetra- means 4, penta- means 5, hexa- means 6, hepta- means 7, octo- means 8, nona- means 9, deca- means 10. <gallery>File:Tin(IV) chloride.jpg|Anhydrous tin(IV) chlorideFile:Tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate.jpg|Tin(IV) chloride pentahydrateFile:Cobalt(II) chloride.jpg|Anhydrous cobalt(II) chlorideFile:Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate.jpg|Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrateFile:Hydrating-copper(II)-sulfate.jpg|Hydrated and anhydrous copper sulfateFile:Copper(II) chloride.jpg|Anhydrous copper(II) chlorideFile:Copper(II) chloride dihydrate.jpg|Copper(II) chloride dihydrate</gallery>
Hydrogen economy	A hydrogen economy is a hypothesis future economy in which the primary energy used for automobiles and other vehicles as well as creating electricity comes from hydrogen and renewable energy sources, like windmills and solar panel.
Hydrogenation	Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to organic chemistrys. It is done to alkenes. Vegetable oil have alkenes in them. Alkenes are liquid and spoil easily. People making shortening add hydrogen to the alkene, turning it into an alkane. The alkanes are more solid and stable. A catalyst is used to react the hydrogen with the oil. This makes trans fats, though. Margarine is an example of a hydrogenated spread. Other things can be hydrogenated, too. Hot nitrogen is reacted with hydrogen under high pressure with a catalyst, usually nickel to make ammonia gas.
Hydrolysis	Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process where a chemical compound reacts with water (molecule). This is the type of reaction that is used to break down polymers into many smaller units. In this reaction, water is always added to the chemical compound.
Hydron	In chemistry a proton is a positively charged hydrogen ion. According to IUPAC, the name hydron should be used for such a particle. In this sense, a hydron can be a proton in the sense of physics, a deuteron or a triton. A deuteron is the ion of deuterium, a triton that of tritium. (So chemists use the term hydron because it covers all three hydrogen ion isotopes.) In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Lowry used hydrons to describe acids and bases. They defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors.
Hydrophobe	Hydrophobe is a term from chemistry for a Chemical substance that does not Mixture with water. Examples of such substances are different types of Vegetable oil, and fats. Many hydrophobic substances are Lipophile, they mix with fats and oils easily.
Hydroponics	Hydroponics or Hydro-culture is the [[wiktionary:Method|method]] of growing plants in the nutrients that they need instead of soil. The plant foods are simply put into water instead and it makes a solution for the plants to live in. Vegetables, flowers and herbs can all be grown in water. It is quite an old idea. The earliest published work on growing terrestrial plants without soil was the 1627 book Sylva Sylvarum by Francis Bacon, printed a year after his death. Water culture became a popular research technique after that.In 1929, William Frederick Gericke of the University of California at Berkeley began publicly promoting that solution culture be used for agricultural crop production. Oliver and Tintin are the pioners of Hydrophonics
Hydroxide	Hydroxide in chemistry is a name given to the diatomic anion OH−, made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Most chemical compounds that contain hydroxides are base (chemistry). An Arrhenius base is a substance that when solvation in an aqueous solution, it produces hydroxide ions. Therefore, hydroxide ions are heavily involved in acid-base reactions. Many useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is used in industry as a strong base, potassium hydroxide is used in agriculture, and iron hydroxide minerals such as goethite and limonite have been used as iron ore. The aluminium ore bauxite is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides. Most inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water.
Hyperbolic geometry	In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry isn't true. On a hyperbolic plane, lines that started out parallel will become further and further apart. Replacing this rule means that hyperbolic geometry acts differently from ordinary flat plane geometry. For example, triangles will have angles that add up to less than 180 degrees, meaning that they are too pointy. Many real objects look like hyperbolic planes. For example, some types of coral and lettuce are shaped like pieces of hyperbolic planes. Other people say that it's easier to draw a map of the Internet when your map isn't flat, because there are a lot of computers around the edges but very few in the center. Some physicists even think our universe is a little bit hyperbolic.
Hyperplane	A hyperplane is a space composed of 1 less dimension than the space that it occupies. Visually, a hyperplane in a two-dimensional space (a [[:en:Cartesian_coordinate_system|Cartesian plane]]) would be a line, which is one-dimensional. A hyperplane in a three-dimensional space would be a plane, or some surface, which is two-dimensional.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol	HyperText Markup Language Transfer Protocol (often abbreviation to HTTP) is a communications protocol. It is used to send and receive webpages and files on the internet. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is now coordinated by the W3C. HTTP version 1.1 is the most common used version today. It is defined in RFC 2616. HTTP works by using a user agent to connect to a server. The user agent could be a web browser or web crawler. The server must be located using a URL or Uniform Resource Identifier. This always contains http:// at the start. It normally connects to port 80 on a computer. A more secure version of HTTP is called HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This contains https:// at the beginning of the URL. It encrypts all the information that is sent and received. This can stop malicious users such as hackers from stealing the information and is often used on payment websites. HTTPS uses port 443 for communication instead of port 80.
Hypervisor	The hypervisor is the device or software which runs the virtual machine. It's typically responsible for allocating the resources, providing the interface between the virtual machine (the "guest") and the host system as well as any management software. eg: if you're using Oracle Virtual Box to run a Ubuntu virtual machine, Oracle Virtual Box is the hypervisor.
Hypnosis	Hypnosis is "a trance state characterized by extreme suggestibility, relaxation and heightened imagination".It is an altered state of consciousness. Usually, one person (the "hypnotist") talks to another (the "subject") in a special way that puts the subject into a . While the subject is in this state, he can be influenced by suggestions. The hypnotist can tell him to forget his name, or that the room is hot (he will start sweating), or that he is someone else. Hypnotic suggestions may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject, or may be self-administered ('self-suggestion' or 'autosuggestion'). The use of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes is referred to as 'hypnotherapy', while its use as a form of entertainment for an audience is known as 'stage hypnosis'. Contrary to a popular misconception—that hypnosis is a form of unconsciousness resembling sleep—some contemporary research suggests that hypnotic subjects are fully awake and are focusing attention, with a corresponding decrease in their peripheral awareness. Subjects also show an increased response to suggestions. However, the behaviour of subjects under hypnotism goes so far beyond normal focused attention that the description of "altered state of consciousness" is more used.
Hypostatic model of personality	The hypostatic model of personality is a way of viewing the many sides of a person's character. The model says that a person can behave and appear to others in many ways, depending on how that person is, but also on how someone looks at that person. It says that people are not one-sided, but are a little bit of everything. For example, today someone can be mean, and tomorrow he can be good. How someone appears also depends on things and people around him or her. For example, sometimes the most coward person may become the greatest hero, if he is called to save someone's life. All these "sides" of a person have to be known by scientists so they can change them for the better.
Hypostyle	In architecture, a hypostyle hall has a flat ceiling supported by columns.
Hypotenuse	The hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degree (geometry) angle in a right triangle. It is always the longest side. For example: In this triangle, if angle C is 90 degrees, then the opposite side, "c", is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is important in trigonometry, where it is used to calculate many function (mathematics). The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using Pythagoras' Theorem. In fact, the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using this theorem.
IC50	The IC50 is a measure of how effective a drug is. It indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell (biology), cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half minimal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). It is commonly used as a measure of Receptor antagonists potency in pharmacological research. Sometimes, it is also converted to the pIC50 scale (-log IC50), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. According to the Food and Drug Administration, IC50 represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition in vitro.It is comparable to an half maximal effective concentration for agonist. EC50 also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect in vivo.<ref name=fda/>
ICANN	ICANN (, eye-can) is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is a non-profit corporation that was made on September 18, 1998.
IEC 61850	The IEC 61850 is a technical International standard in the design of the automation of electrical substations. The standard specifies several protocols.
INTLAB	INTLAB (INTerval LABoratory) is an interval arithmetic library using MATLAB. It is available in Windows and Linux, macOS. It was developed by S.M. Rump from Hamburg University of Technology. INTLAB was used to develop other MATLAB-based libraries such as VERSOFT and INTSOLVER,. It was also used to solve some problems in the Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems.
IP address	An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a computer network, such as the internet. It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a longnumber written in Binary number. Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the Internet Protocol to communicate. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigns IP addresses to Regional internet registry (RIRs). The RIRs assign them to Internet service provider. Internet Service Providers then assign IP addresses to their customers. Very often, people have a router or gateway at home, to which they connect computers, printers, and other devices. These routers or gateways are often configured to assign "local" IP addresses to the devices that are connected. Each address has two parts: One that specifies the computer or group of computers, and another which specifies the Computer network. A device can have more than one IP address. Certain types of IP addresses are used to address a group of devices, while others are used to address only one device. Certain types of addresses are unique, others can be re-used. A number of IP addresses are used for special purposes, for example to obtain an IP address automatically. An IP address is converted to physical or MAC address using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). If an IP address is your phone number, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your phone number, but your name will not change.
IPsec	Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a way of making Internet communications more secure and private. IPsec is a collection of protocols for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authentication (and optionally encryption) each [[packet (information technology)#Example:IP packets|IP packet]] of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of Key (cryptography) to be used during the session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts (e.g. User (computing) or Server (computing)), between a pair of security gateways (e.g. routers or firewalls), or between a security gateway and a host. RFC 2406 IPsec is an end-to-end security solution and operates at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, comparable to network layer in the OSI model. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as Secure Sockets Layer, Transport Layer Security and Secure Shell, operate in the Upper layer protocol of these models. This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application. The term "IPsec" is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled IPSec.
IRC bot	IRC Bots are computer programs. They are used on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to help control and protect chat rooms. They can do many of the things that a human user can do such as gather Information, kick users out of the channel, ban users, or even send stats to other programs and websites. IRC Bots/Chatroom bots are used in many things now, from sending RuneScape statistics, to keeping track of users who abuse the networks. Popular IRC bots include Infobot, blootbot, Supybot.
IZarc	IZArc is a file archiver for Microsoft Windows developed by Bulgarian programmer Ivan Zahariev. The program is freeware, but not open source. IZarc can open the most commonly used List of archive formats, like ZIP (file format), RAR (file format), gzip, tar.gz, bzip2, and 7z, and others many less common formats (48 in total). IZarc has an integration in Windows Explorer and has an Antivirus software feature. IZarc can also do Compact disc image conversions.
Icon	An icon (from the Greek language: , eikon, "image") is an image, picture, or representation which has a religious meaning. It is a sign or a likeness that stands for a real object or person. Although the word icon can be used for images of other religions, it is most often used to describe a painting on a wooden panel that has been done in the Eastern Christianity tradition, and may also be used for carved ivory panels and panels of silver or gold. These icons show a holy being such as Jesus, Virgin Mary, a saint or an angel. They also show scenes from the Bible such as the Crucifixion and scenes from lives of the saints. In Orthodox Christianity an icon is thought of as a window through which a person can get a view of God's truth.
Id, ego, and super-ego	The Id, ego, and super-ego are ideas created by Sigmund Freud. They are three concepts used to explain the way the human mind works. Freud describes the human mind as interaction of id, ego, super-ego. The ego, and to some extent the super-ego, is conscious or on the surface. The id remains unconscious. Together they make up the personality. According to this model of the Psyche (psychology), the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralising role. The id, ego and super-ego are functions of the mind, not parts of the brain. They do not correspond one-to-one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience.
Ideal gas	An ideal gas is a gas with particular characteristics.
Idiot	Idiot is a word used to describe someone who is stupid. The adjective is idiotic. The noun idiocy describes the state of being idiotic. The word can be used in different ways.
Illegal logging	Illegal logging is the name for different practices for the sale of timber in ways that break the laws of a country. This includes Logging, which may be illegal and it includes the transport and sale of timber as well. It is an important problem to be solved. Illegal logging may include logging tree species which are protected by law, or logging them in places where it is forbidden. Illegal logging is a major factor in deforestation. It also threatens many species, because illegal logging may destroy their habitat.
Imagination	Imagination is the ability to form images of things or events in one's mind. When someone imagines something, they are trying to picture something in their mind that they are not experiencing at the moment or that is not really happening.Imagination is a way to have fun, Imagination can also cause distress.
Imagine (3D modeling software)	Imagine could do more than all other 3D modeling and ray tracing (graphics) programs. It came out for the Amiga and later MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. It was created by Impulse (Software company). It uses the .iob extension for its objects. Imagine is based on TurboSilver, which was also for the Amiga and made by Impulse. CAD-Technologies continued distributing the Amiga version. Starting with version 5.1, current customers could get new updates for free in the Amiga Constant Upgrade Program (ACUP) until Imagine 6.0, which never came out.
Immovable property	Immovable property is property that cannot be d from one place to another. It is generally connected to the Earth#Surface or land on which it sits. The term immovable property also includes the land. In real estate law, immovable property has certain rights of ownership that go with title (property) (full or partial) to that property. It generally does not include such things as grass, crops, or Tree.<ref name=LT/> In much of the world's Civil law (legal system) systems is the same as "real property"; it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface. In some countries, China for example, private ownership of land is not allowed. Individuals in China may obtain land rights for a fixed number of years for a fee.<ref name=LOC/> These rights may be ed by legal means including gift or Sales. They may also own houses, buildings or apartments, but not the land they sit on.<ref name=LOC/> In the United States immovable property is also known as real estate. In the United Kingdom it is also known as property.
Impartiality	An [[Wikt:essential|essential]] part of any of the world's List of national legal systems is impartiality. It is important for tribunals, judges, jurys and arbitrators to be impartial. It is equally important for the legal systems themselves to be impartial.<ref name=CaronBEP/>
Impossible object	An impossible object is a kind of optical illusion. Impossible objects are also known as undecidable figures. In this kind of illusion, a person looks at a 2D picture. The vision center of the brain does much of its work subconsciously and automatically. It interprets the figure as a three-dimensional object. The viewer usually knows such an object is impossible soon after looking at the figure. However, the impression of a 3D figure may still remain even when the viewer knows it is impossible in reality. Some of these figures are more subtle. In these cases it is not obvious that they are impossible right away. The viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object to find out that it is indeed impossible. Impossible objects are of interest to psychologists, mathematicians and artists.
Imposter syndrome	Imposter syndrome is a bias in thinking in which the individual believes all of their accomplishments to be the result of coincidence and luck instead of actual skill. This is often combined with the fear of being revealed as a "fraud" or "imposter" who does not deserve the things they have obtained in life.
Impresario	An Impresario is somebody who organizes concerts, operas, ballets or Play (theatre). The word comes from the Italian language word impresa, which means "an enterprise" or "undertaking". Some very famous impresarios from the past include Rudolf Bing, Sergei Diaghilev, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Fortune Gallo, and Sol Hurok.
Impressionist music	The impressionist movement in music was a movement in Europen classical music. It was mostly in France. It began in the late 19th century and ended in the middle of the 20th century. There were two very famous composers of this movement, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Debussy actually did not like the term 'Impressionist' in his works. English impressionist musicians include Cyril Scott (1879–1970) and John Ireland (1879–1962). Other well-known composers labeled impressionist include Paul Dukas, Gabriel Fauré, Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, Giacomo Puccini, Leoš Janáček, Alexander Scriabin and Kurt Atterberg The first pieces of impressionist music were probably composed by Franz Liszt, the first such piece for orchestra is probably Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, composed by Claude Debussy, between 1892 and 1894. The impressionism of Debussy is achieved through a number of means the overall aim of which were to weaken the teleological (Purpose driven) harmonic structure of classical (functional) western harmony. In functional harmony a path is set that leads inexorably to a final cadence at which the tonic is clearly affirmed, dissonance whether through the use of suspensions or 7th chords etc. is correctly prepared and then resolved creating a flow of tension and release. By contrast, many of Debussy's dissonances simply flow onto another dissonance in chains of seventh chords etc. Another way that Debussy holds tonality in suspense is through the use of the pentatonic and whole-tone scales in both melody and harmony. The story of modernist music has been a response to the extreme chromaticism of radical romantic composers such as Wagner and Liszt. The ones who felt compelled to complete the task took music to the chromatic extreme of atonality, others found ways to continue to write music using recognisable harmonic sequences and tonal (therefore recallable) melody by emancipating the dissonance and freeing it from its functional straightjacket. Debussy played a massive part in developing the vocabulary for this kind of composition. All non-atonal composers of the modernist era owe a debt to Debussy, including Stravinsky, Bartok, Messiaen and possibly even Steve Reich.
Improper rotation	An improper rotation can be understood as an inversion followed by a proper rotation. Equivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a point on the Axis (mathematics). Therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion. A simple example of an improper rotation in 3D (but not in 2D) is a coordinate inversion: x goes to −x, y to −y and z to −z. Under this transformation, a and b go to −a and −b (by the definition of a vector), but p clearly does not change. (It follows that any improper rotation multiplies p by −1 compared to the rotation's effect on a true vector.)
Impurity	Something that has impurity is not pure. For example, water that is clean would be called pure water. Water that is dirty would be called impure water. This may result in a change in melting point or boiling point.
Incest	Incest means sexual intercourse between people who are closely . Usually, this means members of the same family. In many societies, it is by law and religion. Which relatives it is forbidden to have sex with depends on the law, religion and culture. If pregnancy is a risk, there may be reasons based on health. Children that result from incest between blood relatives are more likely to have birth defects.
Independent Power Producer	An Independent Power Producer (IPP) or Non-Utility Generator (NUG) is an organisation that owns a Power station and can sell electricity to utility companies and electricity users. An IPP is usually a private company and is generally not a public utility company. Transaction of electricity between IPP with its customers are usually regulated under the Power Purchasing Agreement.
Indian Act	The Indian Act ("An Act respecting Indians"), is a Canada Act of Parliament that concerns registered Indians, their tribe, and the system of Indian reserves. It was first passed in 1876 and is still in force with amendments. It is the primary document which governs how the government of Canada interacts with the Band government and their members. Throughout its long history, the Act has been an ongoing source of controversy. It has been ed in many ways by both Indigenous peoples and non-aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been Amendment many times, including "over twenty major changes" made by 2002.
Indian Penal Code	The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the main criminal code of modern India. It is a code meant to cover all aspects of criminal law. The code was drafted on 6th October 1860. on the recommendation of first law commission of india established in 1834 under the charter Act of 1833 under the chairmanship of Thomas Babington Macaulay.It came into force in British India during the early British Raj period in 1862. However, it did not apply automatically in the Princely states. They had their own courts and legal systems until the 1940s. The Code has been amended several times and is now supplemented by other criminal provisions. After the Partition of India of the British Indian Empire, the Indian Penal Code was inherited by its successor states, the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan (where it continues as the Pakistan Penal Code). The Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) for Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is also based on this code. After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the code continued in force there. The code was also adopted by the British colonial authorities in colonial Burma, Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), the Straits Settlements (now part of Malaysia), Singapore and Brunei. It is the basis of the criminal codes in those countries.
Indian passport	An Indian passport is issued by the India Ministry of External Affairs (India) to Indian nationality law for the purpose of international travel. It enables the bearer to travel internationally and serves as proof of Indian nationality law as per the Passports Act (1967).
Individual retirement account	An individual retirement account or IRA is a form of Pension. It is simply a savings account with large tax advantages. A 401(k) is set up by an employer,<ref name="CNNM" /> but an IRA may be started by an individual. Other IRAs may be opened by small business Ownership and those who are Self-employment.<ref name=CNNM/>
Industrial relations	The field of industrial relations (also called labor relations) looks at the relate between management and workers, mostly groups of workers shown by a trade union.
Inflection point	An inflection point is a Point (geometry) on a curve where the curve changes from being Concave function (going up, then down) to Convex function (going down, then up), or the other way around. An undulation point is like an inflection point but the type of curve doesn't change.
Infobot	Infobot is a Perl IRC bot, first written in 1995 by Kevin Lenzo. The bot's main goal was to remember Uniform Resource Locator and associate them with a name, so if someone needed a specific Uniform Resource Locator they could ask the bot. For this reason, the first Infobot, in the #macintosh channel in the EFnet Internet Relay Chat network, had the nickname 'url'. The main project is now inactive, many Fork (software development) from the original program were made, some of which are still active. Many of these forks carry extra features.
Information leakage	With the development of the internet, the issue of information leakage has been more and more serious. The definition of an information leakage is that secret information is stolen by others through Hacking attack, copying, sending, printing or screen shooting. Most individual information leakages are caused by hackers. This can be prevented by through antivirus software. Most corporate information leakages are caused by people in the company. Preventing corporate information leakage is more difficult. In 2003, the FBI and the CSI did research, the result shows that only 30 percent of information leakage accidents are caused by people outside the organization. That is because people inside are familiar with the regulation and more likely to find the information. Encryption the information is an important way to stop corporate information leakages.
Infrared	Infrared (IR) radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation (a wave with electricity) . The wave is longer than light which humans can see and shorter than microwaves. The word infrared means below red. It comes from the Latin language word infra (meaning below) and the English word red. (Infrared light has a frequency below the frequency of red light.) Red light has the longest wavelength that human eyes can see. Infrared waves cannot be seen by the eye. Near-infrared waves are between 1 E-7 m Nanometre and 1.4 micrometre. Most infrared from the Sun is near-infrared. Thermal imaging is mostly done with Thermal radiation waves between 8 and 15 µm. People sense infrared as heat. Most remote controls use infrared to send the control signals. Many missiles for anti-aircraft warfare find their target by infrared.
Infrastructure	Infrastructure is the term used to describe the facilities which support modern human life. These are the main items: water supply, sewage plants, housing, roads, cable networks, food supply facilities, schools, hospitals, airports, community meeting places, business and government buildings, bridges, railways. In fact, everything that modern life needs in the way of built facilities. Infrastructure is closely connected with standard of living and overpopulation. More people will want more roads, water pipes and other infrastructure. Poor countries tend to have fast population growth and cannot provide the needed infrastructure. Standard of living drops and this may lead to other problems like worsening health, exposure to plague and difficult access of emergency units to those that need it.
Initial public offering	An initial public offering (IPO) or stock market launch is a type of public offering.A public offering is any tradable asset that is offered to the public. In an initial public offering, Share (finance) of stock in a company are sold to the general public, on a securities exchange, for the first time. Through this process, a private company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are used by companies to raise Capital (economics) for expansion and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the money to the people who buy them.
Injunction	An injunction is a court order that either s or s a party from doing a specific act.
Inorganic chemistry	Inorganic chemistry is the branch of chemistry which studies the Chemical element, and inorganic compounds. Inorganic chemistry can be defined simply as all chemistry which is not organic chemistry. Organic chemistry is basically the study of carbon compounds. Inorganic chemistry studies the elements (including carbon), and all compounds other than carbon compounds. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but this definition covers most cases.
Insanity defense	In criminal procedures, the insanity defense is the that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to a mental illness. People who have been determined to be insane have been exempt from full criminal punishment since the Code of Hammurabi. There are different definitions of legal insanity in different jurisdictions. A finding of insanity usually results in the defendant being confined in a Psychiatric hospital instead of a prison.
Insecticide	An insecticide is a poison made to kill insects and spiders. Insects are very tough animals that have adapted to a great variety of settings. Therefore, the poison used to kill them is also deadly to humans. There can be great danger of eating pesticide when you have vegetables. This is why often people will rub an apple on their jumper before eating it. This adds a nice shine to the apple and rubs away some of the pesticides. If you do not clean the jumper there is a risk pesticide might build up.
Insider trading	Insider trading means the trading of public company' stocks and other assets on stock markets using secrecy information. This is done by getting people who have confidential or non-public facts about how much a stock is really to tell traders so they can buy or sell to make profit and manipulate that particular stock. A stock could be worth more or less than the public knows, depending on how well a company is doing in making money, new innovations, sales and demand. In many countries, insider trading with secret information is against the law. Some economists think insider trading should be allowed.
Instaknow Software	Instaknow is a New Jersey-based organization that offers computer programming and system automation services. This technology integrates business processes and information across internal and external systems of various business organizations. Instaknow started deploying Process Automation Solutions in 2003.
Installation (computer programs)	Installation means to put a software on a computer so that the computer can run it. Most software are stored in special ways to make them smaller, or to gather all the different pieces of a software up into one big piece. Before it can be used, though, the software needs to have these changes undone. Some softwares also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on, so while it is installing, it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later.
Instinct	Animals with nervous systems are born with instincts. An instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism. It is heredity (), not learned. However, the term does not include the operation of sense organs, and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system. Instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers. Releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour. Although instincts are not learned, in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice. There are some problems with the term 'instinct'. It can be used loosely to mean a general tendency, such as "a man's instinct is to protect his family". It can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin. Properly, it is used only of well-defined acts whose causation is inherited, and which are triggered by specific stimulus called releasers. Other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns (FAP) and innate behaviour chains.
Instrumental	An instrumental is music that has no words or people singing. The music is made only by musical instruments, or by makings sounds using other things, like bins. Some types of music like Jazz and classical music have a lot of instrumentals, but most other types of popular music do not. Some very popular instrumental songs are:
Insulator (electricity)	An electrical insulator is a material that does not easily allow flow of electricity through an electric current. Materials typically used to insulate include rubber, plastic and glass. In transformers and electric motors, varnish is used. Insulating gases such as Sulfur hexafluoride are used in some switches. Wires that carry electric currents are usually insulated so the electricity goes to the right place. Insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material. They are made of various materials such as: glass, silicone, rubber, plastic, oil, wood, dry cotton, quartz, ceramic, etc. The type of insulator will depend on the uses. Insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity. The insulators prevent the loss of current and make the current more efficient by concentrating the flow.
Integrated development environment	An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a computer program that makes it easier to write other computer programs. They are used by programmer to edit source code, and can be easier to use than other text editor for new programmers. They can have compiler so programmers don't have to open other programs to compile the source code. They also often have syntax highlighting. A feature of an IDE is to check the syntax, and libraries can be added to increase functionality. It also may have predictive coding that can finish lines with syntax such as brackets or semicolons and can suggest variables to be used. It also may have debuggers that can step through lines, take breaks and inspect variables. An IDE often comes with an interpreter and a compiler. Certain IDEs can allow multi-language which means that functions can be written in different languages.
Integrated pest management	In agriculture, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a Pest (biology) control strategy. This strategy uses many different ways to deal with pests: natural predators and parasites, pest-resistant varieties of plants, Culture practices, biology controls, various physical techniques, and pesticides as a last resort. It is an ecology approach that can reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides.
Intellectual disability	Intellectual disability is also called mental retardation, intellectual developmental disability, or general learning disability. It is an illness of the brain. Intellectual disability often starts when someone is very young.
Intensive farming	Intensive farming or intensive agriculture is a kind of farming where a lot of money and labour are used to increase the yield that can be obtained per area of land. The use of large amounts of pesticides for crops, and of medication for animal stocks is common. This is a contrast to traditional agriculture, which does not get as much output per area. When agriculture is intensified, this means that the amount of work needed goes up, until the worker is replaced by a machine. At that point, there will only need to be a few workers to operate the machines. Intensive farming has often been done as a response to rising population levels. It is criticised, because the standards of animal welfare are low. Intensive animal farming leads to increased pollution and to health issues. Modern day forms of intensive crop based agriculture involve the use of mechanical ploughing, chemical fertilizers, plant growth regulators or pesticides. It is associated with the increasing use of agricultural mechanization, which have enabled a substantial increase in production, yet have also dramatically increased environmental pollution by increasing erosion and poisoning water with agricultural chemicals.
Intercropping	Intercropping is growing two or more crops next to each other at the same time. The main purpose of intercropping is to produce more crops in a given area. It also makes use of resources (nutrients) that would otherwise not be used by a single crop. Crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different. This way, the crops can give the same returns but require less space. Things to consider when choosing which crops to mix include the soil, climate and Variety (botany). It is very important not to have crops competing with each other for space, nutrients, water, or sunlight. An example of an intercropping strategy is planting one crop that has deep roots with another that has shallow roots. Intercropping has been proposed as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming, which is very bad for the environment. Conserving soilIntercropping also helps to conserve soil. When One crop is harvested and it starts raining the second crop grown in that farm will not let to erode the soil easily by water. Hence the soil is conserved.
Interest rate	An interest rate is how much interest is paid by borrowers for the money that they borrow. It is usually a percentage of the sum borrowed. So, a simple 10% interest means that if one borrows $100, one pays back $110. Interest rates in a country are usually guided by a base rate set by its central bank. The interest rate to businesses and citizens is always above the base rate .
Interlanguage fossilization	Interlanguage fossilization is when people learning a second language keep taking rules from their native language and incorrectly applying them to the second language they are learning. This results in a language system that different from both the person's native language and second language. In 1972, Selinker showed the concept of "interlanguage fossilization".
Interlinear text	Interlinear text is text on several lines where additional lines give explanations of the main text. That can be a transliteration or a translation of each word of the main line (literal translation) or a free translation of the entire main text line. Interlinear text is usually used to translate or explain the main text. It is used frequently in foreign language material and Linguistics literature. Latin text books and Greek language or Hebrew Bibles with interlinears are common examples.
Intermolecular force	In physics, chemistry, and biology, intermolecular forces are forces that act between stable molecules or between functional groups of macromolecules. These forces are generally much weaker than the chemical bonding forces. Their bonding energies are less than a few kcal/mol. But they are responsible for many different physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. In general one distinguishes short and long range intermolecular forces.(The molecule is a substance are held together by the forces acting between the molecules which are called inter-molecular forces)
International Air Transport Association	The International Air Transport Association is an international industry trade group of airlines. It is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where the International Civil Aviation Organization also is. The main goal of the organization is to assist airline companies to achieve lawful competition and Price fixing.
International Art Society & Academy	The International Art Society & Academy (International Art Society and Academy, Διεθνής Εταιρεία Τέχνης και Ακαδημία) is an art association founded in 2007 by a Greek classical guitarist and composer Yorgos Foudoulis. The Society is in Volos, Greece. Every year the society organizes international art competitions (Interartia, Ithagenia, World Award, World Book Award, Artist of the Year, World Poetry Competition "Manolis Aligizakis") dominantly in various fields of music, but also in poetry, plastic arts and other forms of artistic expression. Since its start the society awarded and collaborated famous and notable artists like Martha Argerich (the winner of the Japanese Premium Imperiale and 3 Grammy awards), Éric Pénicaud, Nobuyuki Tsujii, The Quartetto di Cremona, Peter Bence (Guinness World Record-breaking pianist with "the fastest fingers on the planet"), Fraguial Francisco Guilherme de Almeida Jesus, Alondra de la Parra (the current Music Director of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra), Marco Minnemann, Tolgahan Çoğulu, Sungha Jung, Silesian Guitar Octet and many others. Within the society also is active the International Art Academy which is an examination board based on UK and US models (an international nonprofit training, education, and certifying organization) only for arts. Many well known artists serves as members, mentors or (honorary) professors like Małgorzata Chodakowska (sculpture), Tolgahan Çoğulu, Marios Joannou Elia, Dario Cebić, Pero Šiša, Thelxis Theohari (Θέλξη Θεοχάρη, the author of a number of the public monuments in Greece), Melissa Studdard (an author, the winner of a Forward National Literature Award and Pinnacle Book Achievement Award), Dimitris P. Kraniotis, Candice James (the poet laureate of New Westminster, British Columbia), Robert Hagan (a painter and the host of the Discovery HD/Discovery television show Splash of Color), Miran Vaupotich and others.Yorgos Foudoulis is the president of the International Examination Center of the International Art Academy and the director of the Examination Center of Trinity College London. In addition to these competitions, the International Academy of Arts, with the support of the Directorate for Organizational and Academic Development of the Greek Ministry of Education, traditionally organizes the World Poetry Competition 'K.P.Kavafis'. The International Examination Center at the International Art Academy in Volos acts under the legal framework of Examinations Boards, but all the certificates and substantial (earned) academic degrees in arts are currently issued in an honorary form in order to align itself to the present legal limitations in Greece (despite the fact that IAA is not the university or college per se). According to the State Constitution of Greece, "education at the university level must be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed Public law legal bodies". In cooperation with the Foudoulis Conservatory, the World Guitar Festival Volos, World Guitar Orchestra Volos and World Guitar Center organize the World Composition Competition 'KITHARA' with an emphasis on guitar (solo guitar, musical ensembles, guitar ensembles, orchestras, etc.).
International Association of Aviation Personnel Schools	The International Association of Aviation Personnel Schools (IAAPS) is an association of pilot training organizations created in 1995. IAAPS is recognized by national and international aviation authorities. IAAPS is part of the rulemaking group of the European Aviation Safety Agency. (EASA)
International Auxiliary Language Association	The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 to promote widespread study, discussion and publicity in the establishment of an international auxiliary language, together with research and experiment. Although it was created to determine which auxiliary language was best suited for international communication, it eventually determined that none of them was up to the task and developed its own language, Interlingua. The IALA continued to publish materials in and about Interlingua until 1954.
International Bank Account Number	The International Bank Account Number is an internationally-recognised way of identifying bank account numbers. Its abbreviation is "IBAN". The IBAN was developed to enable people in the European Union to send money to a bank account in another country. When a person uses a computer to make a money transfer, the IBAN has features that allow the person’s computer to check for typing errors.The IBAN is now used in all European countries and also in many Developing country. Developed country outside Europe such as the United States, Australia and Canada do not use the IBAN.
International Clarinet Association	The International Clarinet Association is the main international organization bringing together players of the clarinet. It is based in the United States. The ICA publishes a quarterly journal The Clarinet, produces an annual festival ClarinetFest, supports a research library and score collection, and in other ways advances the international study of the clarinet.
International Data Encryption Algorithm	In cryptography, the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey of ETH Zurich in 1991. It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard. IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard (PES), but with some improvements. Because of this, IDEA was first called IPES (Improved PES). The cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non-commerce use. The name "IDEA" is also a trademark. The patents will expire in 2010–2011. Today, IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt. IDEA was used in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) v2.0 after the cipher used in v1.0, BassOmatic, was found to be breakable. IDEA can be used with the Pretty Good Privacy#OpenPGP standard. IDEA operates on 64-bit Block size (cryptography), using a 128-bit key (cryptography). It contains a series of eight identical transformations (rounds) and one output transformation (the half-round). It does this for a total of 8.5 rounds. The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by Interleave sequence operations from different group (mathematics) — modular arithmetic addition and multiplication, and bitwise Exclusive or — which are chosen to be "algebraically incompatible". Each of the eight round uses six sub-keys, while the half-round uses four; for a total of 52 sub-keys. Each sub-key is a Key size. The first eight sub-keys are extracted directly from the 128-bit key (cryptography), with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group; six rotations generate all sub-keys. The designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions. No successful Linear cryptanalysis or Differential cryptanalysis have been reported. Some classes of weak keys have been found — E.g. (Daemen et al., 1994) — but these are of little importance, being so rare to be explicitly avoided. As of 2007, the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds (the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds).<ref name="A-New Attack-on-6-Round-IDEA"></ref> In 1996, Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA, "In my opinion, it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time." (Applied Cryptography, 2nd ed.) However, by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster Cryptography algorithms, some progress in its cryptanalysis, and the issue of patents. http://slashdot.org/interviews/99/10/.../0832246.shtml
International Fertilizer Development Center	The International Fertilizer Development Center (known as IFDC) is a science-based public international organization working to alleviate global hunger by popularizing agricultural practices and fertilizer technologies to farmers and by connecting farmers to markets.

International Union of Architects	International Union of Architects (, or UIA) is an international organization of architects. The organization is based in Paris, France.
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry	The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is an international organisation that represents chemists in individual countries. It governs everything to do with chemicals, elements and new discoveries. Every chemical known has a common name and a IUPAC name. This is also true for the Periodic table. Every element's name has been approved by IUPAC. This rule does not apply to those elements still given temporary names. The organisation was founded in 1919.
Internet	The Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry many different kinds of information. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world.The Internet was developed in the United States by the "United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency" (DARPA). The Internet was first connected in October of 1969 and was called ARPANET. The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a United Kingdom (UK) scientist named Tim Berners-Lee. Today, people can pay money to access the Internet from internet service providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes people who offer these free services use advertising to make money. Censorship and freedom of speech on the Internet can be controversial.
Internet Key Exchange	Internet Key Exchange (IKE or IKEv2) is the used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. IKE uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to set up a shared secret, from which Key (cryptography) are derived. Public-key cryptography techniques or, alternatively, a pre-shared key, are used to Mutual authentication the communicating parties. IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol.
Internet Movie Database	The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online database of information (facts) about actors, movies, Television shows, and video games. The IMDb database started in October 1990, moved to the World Wide Web in 1993, and has been owned by Amazon.com since 1998.
Internet leak	An internet leak is when someone's personal property is given away to the public on the Internet. This usually happens with copyrighted music and film before it is released properly.
Internet safety	Internet safety is the topic of teaching people how to be Safety when using the internet. It is particularly important when using social media, through which personal information is shared. Internet safety is mainly taught in Primary school and secondary schools and focuses on making sure children know that:
Interplanetary internet	An interplanetary internet does not exist yet. When people talk about an interplanetary internet, they are talking about a problem they are still trying to solve - the problem of making the internet to work between different planets.
Interpreter (computing)	In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that performs commands written in a computer programming language. Interpreters are one of the two most important ways a program can be run, the other being compiler.
Interstellar medium	In astronomy, the interstellar medium (sometimes called the ISM) is the tenuous gas and dust that fills the Void (astronomy) between Stellar system in galaxies, that consisting mainly of huge clouds of ionized, netral, or moleculer hydrogen. This gas and dust not distributed uniformly in interstellar space, but displays significant variations in density, temperature, and ionization state.<ref name=":0" /> Various gases exist in outer space. Most common are hydrogen and helium. Interstellar cosmic dust makes nebulae.
Interstellar travel	Interstellar space travel is manned or unmanned travel between stars. Interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the Solar System, though travel in starships is a staple of science fiction. Actually, there is no suitable technology at present. However, the idea of a probe with an ion engine has been studied. The energy would come through a laser base station. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible. Both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future, particularly for manned probes. NASA, ESA and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years, and have worked out some theoretical approaches. Energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for "generation ships", but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships.
Intolerable Acts	The Intolerable Acts are laws passed by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1774. The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party.
Intranet	An intranet is a private network website that only a few selected computers can have access to. Usually, they are being used as internal company websites for employees to know more about what is happening in the company without letting other people see. An intranet works the same way as a normal website. The system administrator can add webpages to it and it can be accessed normally from a web browser. Russia has successfully tested Runet, a country-wide alternative to the internet. An expert said "Increasingly, authoritarian countries who want to control what citizens see are looking at what Iran and China have already done... It means people will not have access to dialogue about what is going on in their own country, they will be kept within their own bubble".
Introversion and extraversion	Introversion and extraversion is a personality dimension. It was promoted by Carl Jung in the 1920s. Individual people differ on this scale. According to the theory, introverts get energy from inside themselves (ideas and concepts in their own minds), while extroverts get energy from outside of themselves (interacting with other people). There are many ideas about introversion and extroversion which are false, such as the idea(s) that all introverts are shy, antisocial and non-emotional. The idea of introversion and extroversion has been used in many different personality tests and is a key determining factor for many things. Those who follow this way of looking at the world say that everyone has some parts of both traits in them, although one will usually dominate over the other. At one time, extroverts were thought to make up almost three quarters of American society. In more modern times, however, researchers have been able to ascertain that the number of introverts almost equals the number of extroverts in the country. Interestingly, also, the prevalence of both types varies from country to country, with certain nations (Scandinavian countries, Japan) favouring introversion and others (most notably America) favouring extroversion.
Invasive species	An invasive species is a species which is not native to the place where it is found. It has moved from its native area, where it grew naturally, into a new area. Often it becomes a nuisance species, because in its new habitat it lacks its old enemies. Normally, as a species Evolution, so do the things which eat it or parasitism it. Free of natural restraints, the invading species outcompetes its new neighbours. [[:en:Kudzu|Kudzu]], for example, is called "The weed which ate the South" because it went out of control in the southern United States. The introduction of starlings to North America is another example. Natural events sometimes allow species to invade new places, as in the Great American Interchange.
Inverter	An inverter is an Electronic component that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). It is not the same thing as an alternator, which converts mechanical energy (e.g. movement) into alternating current. Direct current is created by devices such as Battery and solar panels. When connected, an inverter allows these devices to provide electric power for small household devices. The inverter does this through a complex process of electrical adjustment. From this process, AC electric power is produced. This form of electricity can be used to power an Lightbulb, a microwave oven, or some other electric machine. An inverter usually also increases the voltage. In order to increase the voltage, the current must be decreased. So, an inverter will use a lot of current on the DC side when only a small amount is being used on the AC side. Inverters are made in many different sizes. They can be as small as 150 watts, or as large as 1 megawatt (1 million watts). Smaller inverters often plug into a car's cigarette lighter socket and provide 120 or 240 volt AC power from the car's 12 volt supply. The earliest inverters consisted of a DC motor connected mechanically to an AC generator. A later design often used with vacuum tube car radios consisted of a rapidly switching relay. Modern inverters are based on MOSFET or IGBT transistors.
Investment	Investment or investing means that an asset is bought, or that money is put into a bank to get a future interest from it. Investment is total amount of money spent by a shareholder in buying Share (finance) of a company. In economic management sciences, investments means longer-term savings. It is a term used in business management, finance and economics, related to saving or deferring Consumption (economics). Literally, the word means the "action of putting something in to somewhere else" (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or 'vestment').
Invitee	In tort law, an invitee is a member of the public who has been [[:wikt:invite|invited]] to do business with the owner of a property. For example, if someone owns a Shop and invites someone else to come into the store to buy something, the person who is invited is an invitee. In some places (or jurisdictions), tort law asks whether a person is an invitee when it decides what Negligence#Duty the owner of land has to keep that person safe from harm.
Iodine test	The iodine test is a test that is able to detect starch using iodine as a chemical indicator. Example uses include brewing beer, and determining when apples are ripe and can be harvested. If starch is present, the iodine solution will turn dark blue/purple. If there is no starch, the iodine will stay brown.
Ion	An ion is an electric charge atom or group of atoms.It can be made from an atom, or from a group of atoms (molecule). It is "electric charged" so it will move near electricity. This is because atoms are made of three smaller parts:
Ion exchange chromatography	Ion exchange chromatography (or ion chromatography) is a process in chromatography that separates ions and polar molecules based on their attraction to the ion exchanger. It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are: "anion-exchange" and "cation-exchange" chromatography. They are used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control. The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, Amino acid, and Peptide bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming Ionic bond to the insoluble stationary phase.The Equilibrium constant stationary phase is made of an ionizable functional groups where targeted molecules of mixtures are separated and quantified while passing through the column. A cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions.
Ionic compound	In chemistry, an ionic compound is a Chemical compound made of ions. They have strong ionic bonds between particles. Lots of energy (heat) is required to break the bond apart, resulting in high melting and boiling points. The ions join together because they have different charges. Compounds of metals and non-metals are usually ionic. They are made when two or more atoms come close together and an electron goes from one atom to the other atom. The electron does this because both atoms want a full outer electron shell, similar to those of the noble gases.
Ionization energy	Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the most loosely attached electron from an atom. The atom is not connected to any other atoms. The chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy. The ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy. The chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy (due to electrons being farther away from the atom with increasing atomic radius). The ionization energy increases as each electron is removed. Ionization energies are dependent upon the atomic radius. Since going from right to left on the periodic table, the atomic radius increases, and the ionization energy increases from left to right in the periods and up the groups. Exceptions to this trend is observed for Alkaline earth metal (group 2) and nitrogen group elements (group 15). Typically, group 2 elements have ionization energy greater than group 13 elements and Group 15 element elements have greater ionization energy than Group 16 element elements. Groups 2 and 15 have completely and half-filled Electron configuration respectively, thus, it requires more energy to remove an electron from completely filled orbitals than incompletely filled orbitals. Alkali metals (IA group) have small ionization energies, especially when compared to Halogen or VII A group. In addition to the radius (distance between nucleus and the electrons in outermost orbital), the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron(s) you're looking at in the outermost shell have an effect on the ionization energy as well. This effect, where the full positive charge of the nucleus is not felt by outer electrons due to the negative charges of inner electrons partially canceling out the positive charge, is called shielding. The more electrons shielding the outer electron shell from the nucleus, the less energy required to expel an electron from said atom. The higher the Shielding effect effect the lower the ionization energy. It is because of the shielding effect that the ionization energy decreases from top to bottom within a group. From this trend, Cesium is said to have the lowest ionization energy and Fluorine is said to have the highest ionization energy (with the exception of Helium and Neon).
Irrigation	Irrigation is when people add water to plants, to help them grow when there is not enough rain. Irrigation water can be pumped from rivers, natural lakes or lakes created by dams, from wells or allowed to flow to the fields by the force of gravity along pipes or open canals.
Islamic geometric patterns	Islamic geometric patterns were the first form of art in the Arabian Peninsula. Most forms of geometric patterns use shapes resembling hexagons, squares, and pentagons. They were originally invented by Euclid, who also invented geometry. They are ususally found on ceilings of churches, in colored or broken glass.
Islamophobia	Islamophobia is a political term and a slur used against people critical of Islam. It literally means the fear of Muslims. It is sometimes used to describe a [[:wikt:hatred|hatred]] of the religion and its followers. "Islamophobia" can supposedly take the form of criticisms against certain ideology positions taken by believers but almost always state the religion itself as the actual problem. In 1996, the Runnymede Trust researched public opinions about Islam. The research showed people have different opinions about Islam. The most negative opinions that some people have about Islam are:
Isolation for the purpose of abuse	Isolation is often used to get more power over a person. This power is then used for abuse. Isolating the victim from the outside world is important to get psychological control over the victim. Isolation reduces the opportunity of the victim to be rescued. It will also make the victim more dependent on the abuser. This includes controlling a persons social activity: the people they see, the people they talk to, and the places they visit. Sometimes it also includes controlling the material they read. It can also include wanting to know where the victim is. Very often, a victim has to get permission to get medical treatment. Isolation is often combined with other forms of abuse:
Isomerization	Isomerization is a thing that happens to molecules and parts of molecules. Isomerization is when a molecule or part of a molecule changes shape but still has the same number of each kind of atom. The atoms change places, but they do not go away. No new atoms come. For example, when a ketose group changes to an aldose group, that is isomerization because both groups are -C2H3O2. They have two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. In the ketose group, the first carbon has a double bond to an oxygen and a single bond to the other carbon. In the aldose group, the second carbon has the double bond to the oxygen, and the hydrogen atoms are in different places. But they both have the same number of each kind of atom.
Isometry	Isometry is a concept of geometry. Isometry means that one shape can be transformed into another, but metrics such as the arrangement of the points with relation to each other stays the same. Examples for isometric transformations are moving a shape, or rotating it.
Israel Broadcasting Authority	Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA; , ) is the public broadcasting authority of Israel. It is in charge of radio and television in Israel.
Italian car number plates	Italian car number plates used to show the place in Italy where the car carrying them has been registered. Now, Italian car number plates have black characters on a rectangle white background, with a small blue part on the right and left. In the current system, which number a car's license gets has nothing to do with where the car's owner lives.
Iwan	An iwan ( eyvān) is defined as a vaulted hall or space, walled on three sides, with one end open.Iwans were a trademark of the Sassanid architecture of Persia. They then found their way into Islamic architecture. Typically, iwans open on to a central courtyard, and have been used in both public and residential architecture.
Izmailovo Kremlin	The Izmailovo Kremlin (Кре́мль в Изма́йлово) is a cultural, commercial and entertainment complex in north-east of Moscow built in the years 1998-2007. It is a wooden building, stylized for Russian architecture. the complex have seven museums and exhibition grounds: the Museum of Russian Folk Toys, the Museum of the Founding of the Russian Navy, the Museum of the History of Russian Vodka, the Museum of Bread, the Museum of Chocolate, the Museum of Miniatures - "World History in Plasticine," the Moscow Museum of Animation, and also a exhibitions "Japan. Dolls, fairy tales, legends.
Jacques Necker	Jacques Necker was a Finance from Geneva who became a finance minister for Louis XVI of France. His dismissal on 1789 caused the Storming of the Bastille.
James Lovelock	James Ephraim Lovelock Order of the Companions of Honour Order of the British Empire Royal Society (born 26 July 1919) is an independent scientist who lives in Devon. He became an environmentalist and futurist. He is best known for proposing the Gaia theory. This suggests the biosphere is a self-regulating system. After the development of an instrument in the late 1960s, Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. He found a concentration of 60 parts per trillion of CFC-11 over Ireland. He went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the research ship RRS Shackleton.
Jane's Walk	Jane's Walk (Named after Jane Jacobs) is a international "New Urbanism movement" held every year in May in a series of cities walking tours. the audience is mostly volunteers who document the city and participate in discussions to improve the city.
JavaScript	JavaScript is a High-level programming language programming language; It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use; JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clock to large Web application; JavaScript is also commonly used in Server programming through platforms like Node.js, or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers; Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java programming language; Though the names of both languages are Trademark of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations;
Jet fuel	Jet fuel is fuel used in certain types of aircraft. It is separated from crude oil in a fractionating tower.
Jiizas: di Buk We Luuk Rait bout Im	Jiizas: di Buk We Luuk Rait bout Im is a translation of the Gospel of Luke from Biblical Greek to Jamaican Patois. It was made for the Jamaican Creole Translation Project, which is done by the Bible Society of West Indies, which is in Kingston, Jamaica. It came out in printed and audio forms in summer 2010. They also made Di Jamiekan Nyuu Testiment, which came out in the United Kingdom and Jamaica in 2012.
Job Control Language	Job Control Language (JCL) is a name for scripting languages used on IBM mainframe operating systems. It instructs the system on how to run a batch processing or start a subsystem. The purpose of JCL is to say which programs to run, using which files or devices for input or output. It can indicate under what conditions to skip a step. There are two distinct IBM Job Control languages:
Job satisfaction	Job satisfaction or employee satisfaction has been d in different ways. It may be as simple as the feeling of satisfaction with a job. If a person likes their job, they feel job satisfaction. When an employee performs their well, they feel a sense of job satisfaction.<ref name="Spector 1997"/> If a worker has good Interpersonal relationship with their and their s, they feel job satisfaction.<ref name="Spector 1997"/> Psychologists who the behavior of industry and organizations also look at job satisfaction in different ways.
John Doe	The name "John Doe" is used as a name in a legal action, case or discussion for a male person, whose true identity is unknown, anonymous or must be withheld for legal reasons. Male Dead bodys or hospital patients whose identities are unknown may also be called "John Doe". The name "Jane Doe" is used for females. John or Jane Doe is also use an example when a name is needed, for instance when showing how a form should be completed. "Joe Bloggs" is sometimes used in such a case.

Johnny Castaway	Johnny Castaway is a screensaver released in 1992 by Sierra Entertainment/Dynamix. It was under the Screen Antics brand and was said to be "the world's first story-telling screen saver". A man, Johnny Castaway, is stuck on a very small island with one palm tree. He often fishes, builds sand castles, and jogs. Other things happen less often, such as a mermaid or Lilliput and Blefuscu pirates coming to the island, or a seagull flying down to steal his shorts while he is bathing. Much like the castaways of Gilligan's Island, he is sometimes almost rescued, but is still on the island because of accidents. Easter eggs happen on some holidays or events often celebrated in the United States, such as Halloween, Christmas and Independence Day (United States), in which a related thing also appears. For example, the palm tree has a "Happy New Year" banner during the last week of the year, and a Jack-o'-lantern is in the sand on Halloween. The time on the computer can be changed to the time of the holiday or event to make it happen at the wrong time. Johnny Castaway came on a 3½-inch floppy disk and required a computer with, at minimum, a 386SX Central processing unit and Windows 3.1. Now it is widely available on the internet, but because it requires 16-bit software components that do not work in modern versions of Windows, it only works on older versions of Microsoft Windows without workarounds, which exist on Windows 64-bit, Mac OS X and Linux. Shawn Bird designed the characters while he was at Dynamix. The program was developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions, the Jeff Tunnell in the name meaning the founder of Dynamix. Ken Williams (gaming) said the screensaver was one of Dynamix's products that did not cost much money to create and make, and made them much more money, along with The Incredible Machine (series) and Hoyle Card Games, which Sierra also published.
Joule's laws	Joule's laws are two: first about heat produced by an electric current, and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure, volume. Joule's first law shows the relation between heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor (material). It is named after James Prescott Joule and shown as:
Judgment	The word judgment (also spelled judgement) means making a decision carefully, after studying and comparing all evidence that is available. A judgment may be about what is the best thing to do, or how to do it, or how to classify something or someone, or what to think about something. Judgment may differ according to the topic:
Judgment (law)	In law, a judgment is a decision of a court regarding the rights and of parties in a legal case or . Judgments also generally provide the court's of why it has chosen to make a particular decision. The phrase "reasons for judgment" is often used interchangeably with "judgment." The former refers to the court's reasons for arriving at the judgment it did. The latter refers to the final court order. a judgement, whether by a court or a tribunal, is the final part of a court case. The judgement is also called a legal decision.
Judicial activism	Judicial activism is about judiciary decisions that are thought of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of judicial restraint.
Judicial opinion	A judicial opinion is a form of legal opinion written by a judge or a of judges explaining how they resolved a Dispute. It cites the Case law reached to the dispute. A judicial opinion usually includes the reasons behind the decision.
Judicial review	Judicial review is the power of a court to decide whether a law or decision by the government is constitutional. This power was established in the United States in the Supreme Court of the United States case Marbury v. Madison. Countries that have judicial review are: India, Ireland, Malaysia, the Philippines, England, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.
Judiciary	In the law, the judiciary or judicial system is the system of courts that administers [[:wikt:justice|justice]] in the name of the Sovereignty or state. A judicial system is used to resolve disputes.
Jure uxoris	Iure uxoris (or Jure uxrois) is a Latin language term that was mainly used in the Middle Ages. It was used to refer to a title of nobility a man used, but which originally belonged to his wife, who also had that title.
Jurisdiction	In law, jurisdiction is the authority given to a judge to take decisions in matters concerning the law. The word comes from the Latin jus, juris meaning "law" and dicere meaning "to speak": and literally means: telling the law. Jurisdiction may be legally restricted to a certain period of time called a statute of limitations. It also includes the authority a of formally constituted legal body or a political leader to deal with legal matters and, by implication, to administer [[:wikt:justice|justice]] within a defined area of responsibility. Jurisdiction relies on Public international law, Conflict of Laws, constitutional law and the powers of the executive (government) and legislature branches of government to give resources to best serve the needs of its society.
Jurisprudence	Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law. Scholars of jurisprudence, or legal philosophers, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems and of legal institutions. As jurisprudence has developed, there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages:
Justice	Justice is a concept on ethics and law that means that people behave in a way that is fair, and balanced for everyone.
Justice of the peace	A justice of the peace (JP) is a judicial officer, election or ed to a local court that has limited jurisdiction. In some locations a JP deals with Moving violation, parking tickets and may have the authority to perform Marriage. In many places they are the entry-level courts that most Criminal law pass through. JP courts were popular in early history, but are now found mostly in rural areas.<ref name=jpUSLegal/> Otherwise people would have to travel longer distances to other courts of law.<ref name=jpUSLegal/>
Kabulig Bikol	Kabulig-Bikol is a group or union of literary writers in Bikol languages.
Kepler's Laws	Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three laws that describe the motion of Planet around the sun:
Kerberos (protocol)	Kerberos (pronounced "kur-ber-uhs") is a computer network authentication cryptographic protocol, which allows people communicating over a Secure channel network to prove their identity to one another in a security manner. It is also a Software suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that implements this protocol. Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication — both the User (computing) and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks. Kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptography shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the security network can be read, modified, and inserted. Kerberos builds on Symmetric-key algorithm and requires a key distribution center. Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication.
Kerckhoffs's principle	Kerckhoffs's principle (axiom, or law) is an idea in cryptography. It was stated by Dutch people cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century. It is:
Key (cryptography)	In cryptography, a key (or cryptographic key) is a piece of information that allows control over the encryption or decryption process. There are two basic types of cryptographic algorithms.
Key derivation function	In Cryptography a key derivation function (KDF) makes a long secret key (which is called a "hash") from a secret phrase, like a password. The output of a key derivation function will look common to another result made from a random phrase. They are also used to re-use secret keys in a specific format, like using a shared secret key from the Diffie-Hellman key exchange for sending secrets in Advanced Encryption Standard.
Key distribution center	In cryptography, a key distribution center (KDC) is part of a cryptosystem intended to minimize the risks of exchanging key (cryptography)s and shared secrets. KDCs often operate in systems when some users may have permission to use certain resources at some times but not at any times.
Key exchange	Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which key (cryptography)s are exchanged between users, allowing use of a Cryptosystem. If two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages, each needs to know how to decryption received messages and to encryption sent messages. The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use. If they use a Telegraph, both will require a copy of the same Morse code. If they use a cipher, they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a Symmetric-key algorithm, both will need a copy of the same key. If an Public-key cryptography with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key. The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so, in such a way, that no one else can obtain a copy. Usually, this required trusted secure channel. With the arrival of (public key / private key) cipher algorithms, the encryption key (aka, the Public-key cryptography) could be made public, since (at least for "high quality" ciphers) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the Public-key cryptography) could decryption the message. In principle, then, the only remaining problem was to be sure that a Public-key cryptography actually belonged to its claimed owner, this is not a problem easy to solve; specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other. In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptography protocol, (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), which allows users to establish secure channels in order to exchange keys, even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel. However, Diffie-Hellman key exchange did not address the "identity authentication" problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity. Public key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of "identity authentication". In their most usual implementation, each user applies to a "certificate authority" for a Public key certificate which serves for other users as a correct (Terminology: non-tamperable) authentication of identity. In contrast, the web of trust system, which do not use central "certificate authority" at all. Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate, (see digital signatures). The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved. In particular, it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically, as, for instance, in electronic commerce. Some of the existing work-around designs work, more or less, but are not fully satisfactory.
Key generation	Key generation is the process of generating Key (cryptography) for cryptography. The key is used to Encryption and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted. Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as Data Encryption Standard and Advanced Encryption Standard) and Public-key cryptography (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a Symmetric-key algorithm; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a Public-key cryptography and a Public-key cryptography. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a Public key certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data. Since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as Transport Layer Security and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer as well as the Secure Shell use a combination of the two in which:
Key schedule	In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers, where the Encryption of data is done in "rounds". The general setup of each round is the same, except for some hard-coded parameters and a part of the key (cryptography), called a subkey. A key schedule is an algorithm that, given the key, calculates the subkeys for these rounds.
Key size	In cryptography, key size or key length is the size (measured in bits or bytes) of the key (cryptography) used in a cryptographic algorithm (such as a cipher). Typical key sizes in modern symmetric ciphers are 128, 192, and 256 bits. Older symmetric ciphers used only 40, 56, or 64 bits, which can be broken by Brute force attack. 128 bits is considered secure against brute-force by traditional computers, but not quantum computers. 192 and 256 bit keys are considered quantum-safe, and Advanced Encryption Standard keys of these lengths are approved for protecting Classified information information. Public-key cryptography ciphers such as RSA algorithm need a much longer key to be secure. RSA keys are typically at least 2048 bits. A large key size alone does not necessarily mean a cipher is secure - there are many insecure ciphers which have a large key size but have other design flaws that allow them to be broken.
Key space	In cryptography, the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible Key (cryptography) that can be used to initialize the Cryptography algorithm. For example, if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of 10 bits, then its key space is the set of all binary numeral system strings of length 10 bits; i.e. we have key space of size 210 = 1024. To avoid attackers from guessing the key using a Brute force attack, the key space is usually designed to be very large. Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be flat, having no or very few weak keys.
Key whitening	In cryptography, key whitening is a technique used to increase the security of block ciphers. It consists of steps that combine the data with portions of the key (cryptography) (most commonly using a simple XOR) before the first round and after the last round of encryption. DES-X was the first block cipher that used key whitening.
Key-agreement protocol	In cryptography, a key-agreement protocol is a cryptographic protocol by which two or more parties can agree on a key (cryptography) in such a way that both have an effect on the results.
Keystone species	A keystone species is a species which has a big effect on its natural environment relative to its numbers. The ecosystem depends on them, and would be much changed if they were not there. This is because they affect many other organisms in the ecosystem. They affect the types and numbers of other species in the community. Some sea stars (e.g. Pisaster ochraceus) prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably. This drives out most other species. The urchin population grows likewise, and destroys coral reefs. Living coral reefs are the habitat for many hundreds of other species. Some other examples of keystone species are the otter, horseshoe crab, and wolf. Sea otters and kelp depend on each other. Without the sea otter, sea urchins would destroy the kelp, and much else in the ecosystem.
Keystream	In cryptography, a keystream is a Stream (computing) of Randomness or Pseudorandomness characters that are combined with a plaintext message to produce an encrypted message (the ciphertext). The "characters" in the keystream can be bits, bytes, numbers or actual Character (computing) like A-Z depending on the usage case. Usually each character in the keystream is either added, subtracted or Exclusive or with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, using modular arithmetic. Keystreams are used in the one-time pad cipher and in most stream ciphers. Block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams. For example, the CTR mode (also known as Integer Counter Mode (ICM)) is a Block cipher modes of operation that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher.
Khamba Thoibi	The "Khamba Thoibi" (), originally spelt as "Khamba Thoibi Sheireng" () (literally, "Khamba Thoibi poem"), is the national epic poem of the Manipuri ethnicity of Manipur. It is written by Hijam Anganghal, based on the legendary love story of Prince Khuman Khamba and Princess Moirang Thoibi of Ancient Moirang, a province in Ancient Manipur.The events in the epic took place during the reign of King Chingkhu Telheiba (1093 AD-1148 AD) in Ancient Moirang. The saga is based mainly on romance, struggle, chivalry and intrigue, popularized by the bards of Moirang kingdom.<ref name="The History of the Zeliangrong Nagas: From Makhel to Rani Gaidinliu - Gangmumei Kabui - Google Books" /> The romantic saga of Khuman Khamba and Moirang Thoibi has deep religious importance to the culture of Meitei people. The terms, "Khamba" means "Ultimate or fullness" and "Thoibi" means "Perfection of beauty and accomplishments".
Khongjomnubi Nongarol	The Khongjomnubi Nongarol, also spelt as the "Khongchomnupi Nongkalol", is an ancient Meitei literary narrative work (Puya (Meitei texts)) about the six girls turning into the Pleiades in the sky.

Kirchhoff's circuit laws	In 1845, German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff described two laws about electrical circuits..These laws are generalizations of Ohm's law.Kirchhoff's circuit laws are very useful in solving circuit problems.
Klein bottle	The Klein bottle is a geometry, named after the German mathematician Felix Klein. He described it in 1882, and named it Klein'sche Fläche (Klein surface). Like the Möbius strip, it only has one surface. Mathematicians call this a Orientability surface. Klein bottles only exist in four-dimensional space, but a model of a Klein bottle can be made in 3D. This model is different from the original because at some point the shape touches itself. In 3D, part of the shape is "inside" the rest. This is not the case in 4D. Some 3D models use different colors to show the 4th component. The part that lies "inside" then has a different color. Because the surface is non-orientable, there is no "inside" or "outside". This means that if a liquid were filled "in the bottle", it would run down its surface. This may not be true for the 3D models of the bottle. The 2-dimensional version of a Klein bottle is a Möbius strip.
Kleksography	Kleksography are the images of various figures from Ink. Justinus Kerner was the first who included kleksography in the book of poetry. In the 19th century, kleksography were created from inkblots as one another method of writing with the feather.

Some people do not like the Knowledge Graph because it does not cite any sources. Information from the Knowledge Graph is used to answer spoken questions in Google Assistant and Google Home voice queries. Google shows most searched query as the knowledge panel where user gets all the relevant information on one place.
Knowledge of results	Knowledge of results is a term in the psychology of learning.p619 A psychology dictionary defines it as feedback of information:
Known-plaintext attack	The known-plaintext attack (KPA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext and its encryption version (known as ciphertext version) then they can use them to expose further secret information after calculating the Key (cryptography). Encrypted file archives such as ZIP file format are very prone to this attack. For example, an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the "known-plaintext". Then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive. Classical ciphers are typically susceptible to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely.

This mark of excellence is known across the world and there are four levels of excellence. There are 100 possible base points distributed across five major credit categories: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, plus an additional six points for Innovation in Design and an additional four points for Regional Priority. Buildings can qualify for four levels of certification. LEED is not a standard but an evaluation grid. LEED is a way to think up and realise art projects in a durable way. LEED only applies to buildings and not to products.<ref name=NRDC /> It is not a prize but a certification that is delivered by the CaGBC (Canada Green Building Consil). They are the ones who will make sure that all the points are well applied and respected. So, LEED is a grid that helps us obtain a maximum gain of money, health conditions and restrictions on earth pollution. If there is a house to build in Canada, we must do the excavation and that earth is usually brought to a landfill. But, if you want to stay within LEED standards, that earth must be left on the site. Also, if you have to demolish a building, you must use and demonstrate that you recycled all materials in the construction. Also, that you used the maximum quantity of material possible from the old building to the one being built.<ref name=NRDC />

Landscape urbanism	Landscape urbanism is a new theory in the field of Urban Planning that first appeared in the late 20th century claiming that the best way to organize cities is through the landscape design of the city rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase urban landscape first appeared in the mid-1990s. Since then this phrase has received many different uses but is most often cited as a post-modernist response to the failures of "New Urbanism". In 2008 the first Biennale in the world of "Landscape Urbanism" was held in the city of Bat-Yam in Israel which dealt with New Urbanism.
Language	Language is the normal way humans communication. Only humans use language, though other animals communicate through other means. The study of language is called linguistics. Human language has syntax, a set of rules for connecting words together to make Proposition and questions. Language can also be changed, by adding new words, for example, to describe new things. Other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre-set functions. Language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make Sign language. It follows that language is not just any way of communicating. Even some human communication is not language: see non-verbal communication. Humans also use language for thought.

Law	Law is a set of rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society. Courts or police may enforce this system of rules and punishment people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine, or other punishment including jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. But many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society, they have resulted in conflict. To prevent this, in most countries today, laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed peoples. Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail. Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do. An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws. A legal code is a written code of laws that are law enforcementd. This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments.

That is clearly an extension of its original meaning(s) which were about individual people. Buddha and Confucius and other religious and philosophical teachers have left moral legacies. More than 2000 years ago the Ancient Greece Mathematician, Euclid, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements. Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics. Other sciences also owe inherited much from Ancient Greece, and science, in general, is a system of legacies. Greek science developed from Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian science, as Islamic science used its own legacy rather than of those of other cultures. Renaissance science built on its predecessors, as did modern science. In Athens, citizens voted on what the city would do. This early form of democracy is a cultural legacy. Ancient Rome elected some of their leaders and made Roman laws that became a legal legacy for later civilizations. Roman and Greek architecture are also often imitated, as another kind of legacy. Some family pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation. These heirlooms and ideas can also be called legacies.

Lessepsian migration	Lessepsian migration is the name given for the migration of Ocean species through the Suez Canal, between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. It is named after Ferdinand de Lesseps, who built the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal joined two biospheres that were separate before. Many species migrated from the Red Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean. Only a few species migrated in the other direction, from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. The migration can be seen most clearly when looking at fish species, even though other animals also migrated. When the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, it created the first salt-water passage between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes are two very salty (Salinity) lakes about mid-way in the canal. At first, this blocked the migration of species from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. Over the last decades, the salinity of the lakes changed, which made it easier for species to migrate. The Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean, at high tide, water flows from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The Red Sea is also poor in nutrients, so species who migrate will find more nutrients. The waters of the Red Sea are saltier than that of the Mediterranean. For these reasons, most species migrate from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, and only very few migrate in the other direction. When the Aswan High Dam was built in the 1960s, this blocked the flow of freshwater from the Nile into the Mediterranean. As a result, the salinity levels in the Eastern Mediterranean increase, and make it much more like the Red Sea – this means that migration will become even easier, as conditions are very similar. Invasive species coming from the Red Sea and introduced species into the Mediterranean by the construction of the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem. They have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and endemism Mediterranean species. To this day, about 300 species native to the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean Sea, and there are probably others still unidentified. The Egyptian government announced it plans to deepen and widen the canal. This announcement has raised concerns from marine biologists, who fear that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, and make the crossing of the canal easier for additional species.<ref>Galil, B.S. and Zenetos, A. (2002). A sea change: exotics in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in: Leppäkoski, E. et al. (2002). Invasive aquatic species of Europe: distribution, impacts and management. pp. 325–36.</ref> Today, the term Lessepsian migration is used more broadly for any migration of animals over man-made structures.
Letters patent	Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, or government. They are generally used in granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices. They may be used for the granting of city status or a heraldry. Letters patent are issued for the of representatives of the Crown, such as Governors and Governors-General of Commonwealth realms. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of Peer of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law). This grants exclusive rights of an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent).<ref name=invest/> In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid . It is also important to understand how to "practice" the invention or put it into practical use. The opposite of letters patent are letters close. These are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents.<ref name=Bouvier190/> Letters patent are comparable to other kinds of open letters in that their audience is wide.
Lewis acid	The concept of Lewis acid and Lewis base is one of acids and bases, which is independent of the idea of hydrons. [[:en:Gilbert_N._Lewis|Gilbert Newton Lewis]] developed this idea in the early 20th century. In this concept, a Lewis acid can accept and bind electrons. Lewis acid is a substance that accepts two electrons to form a covalent bond. A Lewis base is a substance that gives two electrons in the bonding. A Lewis acid together with a Lewis base will chemical reaction to make a compound called a Lewis adduct.
Lexeme	Lexeme is a term in linguistics. They are units of meaning, independent of any inflectional endings, or whether it is one word or several. "Come in" is a lexeme; so is "raining cats and dogs". The largest English dictionary have about half a million lexemes. "The true figure is undoubtedly a great deal higher". In the English language, run, runs, ran and running are forms of the same lexeme, conventionally written as RUN. A similar concept is the lemma (linguistics) (or citation form). It is the form of a lexeme which is chosen to represent the lexeme, for example, RUN instead of the other forms. Lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords. Other forms of a lexeme are usually listed later in the entry. So all headwords in a dictionary are lexemes. A lexicon is made of lexemes.
Leyden jar	The Leyden jar (or Leiden jar) is a device for storing static electricity. It is large glass bottle, usually lined on both the inside and the outside with some type of metal foil. Some of the early ones had water inside. They allow the experimenter to collect a large amount of charge. They are the first form of electrical storage. These methods are known today as 'condenser (apparatus)' or 'capacitors'. The first electrical storage jar was created by Dean Edwald von Kleist on 11 October 1745. He was the dean of the cathedral of Cammin in Pomerania, on the north coast of Germany (at that time a separate country). He was interested to find whether static electricity could be stored in a bottle, because he knew that electricity could not pass through glass. He thought he might be able to capture and hold a small amount. He only had a small experimental friction generator. He underestimated how much electricity a small medicine bottle could hold by thousands of times. A peculiarity of electricity allows it to continue flowing into the bottle provided the outside of the bottle has an electrically conductive surface connected to the earth. This neutralises the pressure from the charge trying to flow back out. In von Kleist's case, this electrically conductive surface was just his hand, but it was enough to allow a very substantial charge to enter and remain in the jar through a nail he had driven through the cork. When he accidentally touched the nail, he received such a shock that it threw him across the room. He had made a connection between the inside charge and the accumulated outside charge, and since these were opposite signs (one positive and the other negative) all the accumulated charge flowed through his body. He didn't understand why this jar stored so efficiently, but he send a scrambled description to some associates in Berlin, and one copy was sent on to von Klein's old university associate Andreas Cunaeus where it ended up in the hands of Pieter van Musschenbroek, who was the University of Leyden's main physics professor. He worked out that the storage capacity was vastly improved only if the flask was held in the hand, and his letter to scientist in France gave the jar the name "Leyden jar". For many years the Leyden jar was the main tool of electrical storage, and it remained so until the invention of a chemical battery and electrical generators of the type we use today.
Libido	Libido is a person's 'sex drive'. A person's overall sexual drive (desire for sexual activity) varies greatly. Someone with a libido is called an allosexual. Someone without it is called asexual. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Sex hormones liketestosterone, and neurotransmitters like dopamine affect the libido. Both of these work on a brain nucleus (brain) called the nucleus accumbens (one in each half of the brain). These centres work on motivation, learning, and reinforcement. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress (biology), can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medication, lifestyle and intimacy issues, and age (e.g. puberty).
License	A (license for American English) or (licence for British English) allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do. A person usually has to pay some money, and maybe pass a test to get a license. A license is usually written but it does not have to be. Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to. Licenses may be temporary or permanent. Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given. A person with a license is called a licensee. In many countries, if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it, they might have to pay a fine or go to prison.
Lien	A lien ( or ) is a form of security interest attached to property to secure the payment of a debt to a creditor. A lien is usually a public record. The creditor or person holding the lien is called the lienor or lien holder. In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of legal interests. It includes other forms of Mortgage law or charge. In the USA, a lien is a non-possessory security interests meaning the lien holder does not usually possess the property. In other common law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest. The holder of a lien right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely possessory form of security interest. When possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.
Lift (force)	The lift force, lifting force or simply lift is the sum of all the Force (physics) on a body that force it to move perpendicular to the direction of flow. The most common type of lift is that of a wing of an aircraft. But there are many other common uses such as propellers on both aircraft and boats, rotors on helicopters, blades, sails on sailboats, and wind turbines. While the common meaning of the term "lift" suggests an "upwards" action, lift can be in any direction. For instance, for a sail the lift is horizontal, and for the wing on a race car the lift is down. There are a number of ways of explaining the production of lift; some are more complicated than others, some have been shown to be false. The simplest explanation is that the wing deflects air downward, and the Newton's_laws_of_motion#Third_Law pushes the wing up.
Light curve	In astronomy, a light curve is a graph that shows the brightness of light from a celestial object or region, over a certain amount of time. The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band. Light curves can be periodic, that is they repeat in a regular pattern. Examples are eclipsing binary and cepheid variables. Light curves can also be aperiodic, that is they are irregular with no pattern. Examples include the light curve of a nova, a cataclysmic variable star, a supernova or a Gravitational microlensing. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can give a lot of information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it.
Lightning rod	A lightning rod or lightning conductor is an metal rod that is used to make lightning strike it, rather than strike something else. It is part of a lightning protection system. Such a system is made of many such rods. These rods are usually placed at high points of buildings and structures. In addition, paths are made the electricity can take from the rooftop to the ground, it was made in the year 1749 later improved in 1752.
Lightning strike	A lightning strike (or a lighting bolt) is a line of electric energy that is made during thunderstorms. It is very powerful and can kill anyone that it touches. It usually strikes tall objects such as skyscrapers, trees and mountains. A few people have survived lightning strikes.
Lime kiln	A lime kiln is a kiln used to produce Calcium oxide by the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate). The chemical equation for this chemical reaction is:
LimeWire	LimeWire is an open source, peer-to-peer computer program that can be used to download and share music, video, other computer programs, and other kinds of Computer file. In 2010 the RIAA took the makers of LimeWire to the federal court in New York City. They said that the software allowed people to download and share music, which was against the law. In June 2010, the National Music Publishers Association also took legal action against LimeWire. LimeWire was shut down in October 2010.
Line	A line is the path of one point moving. A line has length but no width. A line is a type of geometry . A line is made up of an Infinity number of point (geometry).
Line segment	In geometry, a line segment is a line between two different endpoints. It is represented by a line above the symbols of the two endpoints (such as \overline). Unlike a line, a line segment does not extend beyond the endpoints. An example of a line segment is a side of a triangle. If the endpoints are on a curve, like a circle, then the line segment is called a Chord (geometry).
Linear cryptanalysis	In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding Affine transformation approximations to the action of a cipher. Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis. A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple Linear approximation or including Nonlinear system expressions. Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs.
Lineman (technician)	A lineman (American English) or linesman (British English, not to be confused with linesman (soccer)), is a trained tradesman who builds and maintains Electricity and telephone networks and their infrastructure, such as supporting poles and pylons. The word lineman/linesman refers to those who work in generally outdoor installation and maintenance jobs. Those who install and maintain electrical wiring inside buildings are electricians.

Graduate from the École nationale supérieure de mécanique et d'aérotechnique and from the École nationale de l'aviation civile, he is the founding President of the regional airline Airlinair, President of Transavia.com France and of the Fédération nationale de l’aviation marchande. In September 2011, he almost became chairman of Air France. Lionel Guerin is an environmental activist. He likes parrots. He also likes supporting Sustainable development aviation. Guérin received the Legion of Honour award.
Lipid	A lipid is a type of organic chemistry molecule found in living things. It is oily or waxy. Fats are made from lipid molecules. Sources of lipid can be found in algae, seeds, meat, cheese, butter and fish. Lipids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen molecules. Lipids are classified as simple and complex. Examples of complex molecules could be steroids or phospholipids. A very important biological function of lipids is as lipid bilayers, the basis of many cell membranes. Another function of lipids is to serve as an energy reserve. Lipids can be hydrophobic (non-polar), or amphipatic (containing both polar and non-polar parts). Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), glycerides, phospholipids, and others. The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, signal transduction, and acting as components of cell membranes.
List of BitTorrent clients	A BitTorrent client is a software that downloads files using the BitTorrent (protocol). The first client, known as BitTorrent (software), was created by Bram Cohen in the summer of 2002. Most of the other clients are based in part on BitTorrent. Programs that use BitTorrent protocol are:
List of best-selling singles	This is a list of best-selling single (music) in the world. The Guinness World Records named the holiday music single "White Christmas" (1942) by Bing Crosby as the best-selling single worldwide. According to Guinness, "White Christmas" sold over 50 million copies. The single is known as the "best-selling single of all time". It was released before music charts were created. The song "Candle in the Wind 1997"/"Something About the Way You Look Tonight" (1997) by Elton John, is "the biggest-selling single since United Kingdom and United States singles charts began in the 1950s". The recording was a tribute to Princess Diana. It sold 33 million copies, making it the third best-selling single of all time.

Literary term	A literary term is a word that is used in talking or writing about books and narrative. They are words used to describe various forms of writing by an author.
Literature	Literature is a group of works of art made up of words. Most are written, but some are passed on by word of mouth. Literature usually means works of poetry, theather or narrative that are especially well written. There are many different kinds of literature, such as poetry, plays, or novels. They can also be put into groups through their language, history period, origin, literary genre, and subject. Most of the earliest works were epic poems. Epic poems are long stories or myths about adventures. Ramayana and Mahabharta, two Indian epics, are still read today. Odyssey and Iliad are two famous Greek poems by Homer. They were passed down through speaking and written down around the 8th century BC. Literature can also mean imagination or creative writing, which is looked at for its artistic value.
Loanword	A loanword is a word that is by a language that comes from another language. Since people who speak different languages often need to talk to each other, it is actually very common for languages to "borrow" words from other languages. Examples of this can be seen in the English language because it has many loanwords. When the Normans took over England during the Norman conquest of England in 1066, they made French language the official language of England. Since then, many French words later became English words. For example, the English words beef, pork, poultry, and mutton are loanwords based on the Norman French names of the animals Cattle, Pig, chicken, and Domestic sheep in that same order. In English, the loanwords mean the meat of those animals specifically. Since later the British Empire took over many different countries and people, they also borrowed many words from the languages of the people they took over. An example of this is the word "", which is a Hindi word that has been adopted into English. Languages often use loanwords because cultures learn about new ideas and Invention from people of the languages they borrow from. For example, in English the names of meats and Wine often come from French language, musical Vocabulary often come from Italian language, and Philosophy terms often come from German language. Although native English speakers are now familiar with Chinese ideas and inventions, they are often called by their Japanese names in English because these were introduced to Americans through Japan. China, on the other hand, was closed off from the world when its ideas and inventions spread throughout the world because its Communism government stopped communication with most outside countries, including United States. The names of food are some of the most common loanwords across languages because people may not have any idea of what the food is like when they are first introduced to a certain culture. For example, Italian food usually has Italian names like spaghetti and pasta, Japanese food has Japanese names like sushi and tempura, and Mexican food has Spanish names like tacos and carnitas.
LockWiper	LockWiper is an iOS application developed by iMyFone. It enables users to remove various locks from iPhone, iPad, iPod touch devices. LockWiper can remove the Apple ID without a password, remove the iPhone passcode, and it can also bypass the MDM activation screen & remove MDM Profile from iPhones. According to its website, the iMyFone LockWiper app can remove iPhone passcode from locked, disabled, broken screen and quickly bypass Screen Time or Restrictions passcode without data loss.
Lockman Hole	The Lockman Hole is an area of the sky which is like a clear window into far distant space. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, most directions are partly blocked or obscured by H I region. These glow faintly with infrared light and obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. The H I clouds interfere with observations at those wavelengths in nearly all other directions. So the Lockman Hole is an attractive area of the sky for observational astronomy surveys. It is near the pointer stars of the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major. is about 15 square degrees in size,<ref></ref><ref></ref> and is named after its discoverer, astronomer Jay Lockman.
Locus (mathematics)	In geometry, a locus (plural: loci) is one of a set of Point (geometry) which satisfies one or more s. The usual results are a curve or a surface. For example, all points in a plane (geometry) an equal distance from a center point result in a circle.<ref name=MIF/>
Loebner prize	The Loebner prize is an award given out every year to a chatterbot. The winner is chosen by a Turing test: Each judge talks (-based) to a chatterbot and to a human. The judge guesses which is which. The contest started in 1990 by Hugh Loebner.
Lorenz cipher	The Lorenz cipher was the German rotor stream cipher machines used by the German Army during World War II. This machine and its messages were eventually worked out by the team at Bletchley Park during World War II. British cryptanalysts (codebreakers) worked out its logical structure three years before they saw the machine.<ref>Copeland, B. Jack, ed 2006. Colossus: the secrets of Bletchley Park's codebreaking computers. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4</ref>
Loudness war	The loudness war is a negative term that describes the apparent competition to release Album that are increasingly loud. Albums that are "victims of the loudness war" have less good sound quality because the dynamic range has been compressed to make the music louder. Examples of albums that are victims of the loudness war include Death Magnetic by Metallica. Record producer Charles Dye started an organization called Turn Me Up! that campaigns to give musicians the choice to make albums with bigger dynamic range. In March 2010, mastering engineer Ian Shepherd organised the first Dynamic Range Day.
Low voltage ride through	Low voltage ride through (LVRT) is the capability of an electrical [[:wikt:device|device]] to function normally during periods of low voltage. Many electrical devices in general must have a minimum amount of voltage for them to be able to work. If the voltage is too low the equipment will not work correctly or the Energy efficiency will be reduced.
Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter	The Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter or LGW is a Germany airline.
Luminous intensity	In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction per solid angle unit, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The International System of Units unit of luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.
Lunatic	Lunatic is an old term that was used to refer to a person with a mental illness, or a Intellectual disability. The term goes back to the Latin word lunaticus, which means ' of the moon', or moonstruck. It was also used in English law until about 1930, when it was replaced by "person of unsound mind". Starting 1959, English law speaks about "mental illness".
Lungi	The Lungi, or Tahband, is a type of Sarong that originated in the Indian subcontinent. Most popular in Bengal. It can be described as an ethnic lower garment and a men's skirt that is wrapped around the lower waist, usually below the belly button. Lungis are traditionally worn in Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Nepal.
Luthier	A luthier is a person who repairs guitars, violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and other wooden stringed instruments. These instruments need regular adjustments and minor repairs, especially straightening the bridge. As well, sometimes instruments are damaged in accidents, and a luthier has to use wood glue, broken pieces, and clamps to repair the instrument. Luthiers also have the ability to create wooden stringed instruments, mostly classic string family instruments. The French word lutherie is referred to the art to build wooden instruments. The word luthier comes from the French word luth, luth comes from the Arabian word al-`ūd (العود), this last word means lute, although its generic meaning is the wood. The German word for luthier is luther, that word has became also in a name (Martin Luther King) and in a last name (Martin Luther)
Lycos	Lycos is a Web search engine and web portal centered around broadband entertainment content.
MQV	MQV (Menezes-Qu-Vanstone) is an authentication Cryptosystem for Key-agreement protocol based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme. MQV provides protection against an active attacker.
MU*	MU* refers to a family of text-based online game servers:
MacGuffin (cipher)	In cryptography, MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption. It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure, known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel cipher (GUFNs). Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on Data Encryption Standard, their main change was spliting the DES Block size (cryptography) data block into two unequal halves in the Feistel cipher, 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function, whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block. MacGuffin's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself. Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network, decryption is easy; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse. The algorithm was experimental, intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks. The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly, so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel. They also tried attacking MacGuffin with different Substitution box, taken directly from DES. This version was slightly stronger. Rijmen and Preneel warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle. Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds, and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key.
Machine translation	Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the acronym MT, is part of computational linguistics. It looks at the use of computer software to translation text or speech from one natural language to another. At its basic level, MT performs simple [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]] of words in one natural language for words in another (see: Literal translation). Current machine translation software often allows to adapt the translation to subject or profession (such as meteorology) — to improve output by limiting the allowable substitutions. This technique is very effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used. It follows then that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text.
Magical thinking	Magical thinking is a kind of thinking that looks for relationships between actions and events that can not be proved by reason and observation. Examples of magical thinking include some forms of prayer, some religious or magical rituals, superstitions, and taboos. The rain dance is a form of magical thinking. The dancers believe that the actions and songs used in the rain dance will cause rain to fall. Faith healing is a form of magical thinking where the healer says prayers, puts their hands on the sick person in the belief that the healer's actions will cure the person. Explanations for magical thinking include coincidence, the placebo effect, delusion, staged events, and natural causes. See materialism. In psychology, magical thinking may lead people to believe that their thoughts by themselves can cause effects in the world or that thinking something is the same as doing it. It is a type of incorrect reasoning that looks for meaningful relationships between coincidences. However many people believe supernatural things do happen sometimes. To believe all explainable events are simply due to magical thinking is a form of scepticism.
Magna Carta	The Magna Carta was a document that was sealed by John of England after negotiations with his barons and their French and Scots allies at Runnymede, Surrey, England in 1215. There they sealed the Great Charter, called in Latin Magna Carta. It established a council of 25 barons to see John keep to the clauses, including access to swift justice, parliamentary assent for taxation, scutage limitations, and protection from illegal imprisonment. Because he was forced to seal the charter, John sought approval to break it, from his spiritual overlord Pope Innocent III. Denouncing it as "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust", the Pope agreed. The Magna Carta is still considered one of the most important documents ever written, having inspired the way we view issues of justice and liberty and influenced laws regarding such throughout the world. The Magna Carta has influenced English law right down to the present day. It is one of the most celebrated documents in the History of England. It is recognized as a cornerstone of the idea of the liberty of citizens.
Magnetic reluctance	Magnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuits. It is like Electrical resistance in an electrical Electrical network, but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy. As an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance. It is a scalar (physics),Intensive and extensive properties#Extensive quantity, like electrical resistance. Reluctance is usually represented by ℜ.
Magnitude (astronomy)	The apparent magnitude () of a celestial object is a number that measures its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its Magnitude (astronomy) value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky. Magnitude is a logarithmic measure. It is measured in a specific wavelength or passband, usually in light or infrared wavelengths. A full moon is −13 magnitude and the brightest planet Venus measures −5. The brightest man-made objects, Satellite flare, are ranked at −9 and the International Space Station measures −6.
Magnum opus	A magnum opus or chef-d’œuvre is an artist's or other person's best painting, song or other art. It is Latin language for "great work."
Magua (clothing)	The magua ( Manchu: olbo) was a style of jacket worn by males during the China Qing dynasty (1644–1911). It was designed to be worn together with the Changshan (). It was worn by Manchu people throughout China from the reign of the Qing Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643-1661) until the time of the Kangxi Emperor, (r. 1661-1722).
Maibi Jagoi	"Maibi Jagoi" () (literally, "Priestess' dance") is a traditional dance form performed by the maibis (priestesses) during the religious festival of Lai Haraoba. The dance form is enacted in various ways depending on the variation of the regions. The Maibi Jagoi dance form performed by the female priestesses of the Leihou tribe is one of the most remarkable one.Due to its unique way of performance and costume,The maibis (priestesses) also enact "Laihou Jagoi" ("Dance of invitation"), along with the performance of "pena", a traditional music instrument.
Maillard reaction	The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between an amino acid and a reducing sugar that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. Seared steaks, pan-fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, as well as many other foods, undergo this reaction. The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the Nucleophile amine of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of aromas and flavors. At higher temperatures, caramelization and subsequently pyrolysis become more pronounced.
Malayo-Polynesian languages	The Malayo-Polynesian languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages. There are about 385.5 million people who speak these languages. The Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the Austronesian people of the island nations of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean. There are a smaller number in continental Asia. Malagasy language is spoken on the island of Madagascar. Part of the language family shows a strong influence of Sanskrit and Arabic language as the western part of the region has many s of Buddhism, Hinduism, and, since the 10th century, Islam.
Management buyout	Management buyout is when a company's managers buy a large part or all of a company. They may buy from private owners or from a parent company. Management and leveraged buyouts were a phenomenon of the 1980s. Leveraged buyouts use borrowed money. The venture capital industry has played a crucial role in the development of buyouts in Europe, especially in smaller deals in the UK, the Netherlands, and France.
Mannerism	Mannerism is a style of art that was created in the Late Renaissance period, from about 1520 until about 1600. The Mannerist style of painting or sculpture often shows figures that are "elongated" (made longer) and "distorted" (made into strange shapes"). The aim of the Mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked "elegant".<ref name=Gardner/> The Mannerist style began in Italy, where the artists were influenced by the figures that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling and in the "Last Judgement" in the Sistine Chapel. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard to learn from nature, and to paint things in a way that was very realistic. These two famous painters both died around 1520. Many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to "express themselves". They were not going to follow the rules of anatomy and Perspective (graphical) in the way that Leonardo and Raphael did.<ref name=Gardner/> Mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting, writhing or fighting. The faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred or sexual feelings. Not all the painters who were working during the Mannerist period painted in the Mannerist style. Many artists continued to work in the style of the High Renaissance. Mannerism spread from Italy to France, Germany and Spain. One of the most famous Mannerist painters was El Greco who worked in Spain.<ref name=Gardner/> Some other artists who worked in the Mannerist style are the French sculptor Jean Goujon, the Dutch painter Abraham Bloemaert and the German painter Bartolomeus Spranger. Possibly the strangest paintings from this time were by Giuseppe Arcimboldo who did pictures in which people's faces seem to be made from fruit, flowers, fire and even fish.<ref name=Wolf/>
Manure	Manure is organic matter used as fertilizer in agriculture. Manures improve the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacterium in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the fungus and bacteria in a chain of life. The term "manure" was used for inorganic fertilizers in the past, but this usage is now very rare. Manure from birds and bats is called guano.

Marine reserve	A marine reserve is a type of marine protected area. The protection is for seas, oceans, estuary or large lakes. Laws protect the plants and animals in a reserve. The area is kept safe for Conservation biology and to provide special opportunities for study or research. In a marine reserve people are not allowed to take plants or animals, except for research. This includes fishing. People are still allowed to swim or Scuba diving. The Ningaloo Reef in Australia is an example of a marine reserve. This reef includes six of the seven types of sea turtles in the world. Another example is Hol Chan Marine Reserve in Belize. Hol Chan includes coral reefs and a mangrove forest.
Marker	A marker is a writing device that allows a person to draw, write, or scribble. Ink comes out of the tip of the marker and onto the writing surface, commonly a piece of paper. Markers generally come in a variety of different colors. They are sometimes referred to as "magic markers", or magic pens. The tip of the marker where ink comes out from is usually made of cloth. This allows the ink to go through easily. A lot of ink can come out from it at one time.
Market town	Market town is a word in law that came from the medieval period. It means a settlement in Europe that has the right to have markets. This separates them from villages and city. A town may be described as a market town or as having market rights even if it does not have a market anymore, provided the right to do so still holds.
Mask	A mask is a type of clothing which covers the face. It is similar to a veil, but more close-fitting.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs	Maslow’s hierarchy of needs was created by American psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943. Maslow suggested that human needs could be put into five levels.
Mass hysteria	Mass hysteria is a phenomenon when a large group of people share a common emotion. This emotion can be positive, such as people being Euphoria at a rock concert, or it can be negative, like after a great person or statesman died. It was first used by the Quarteerly Christian Spectator in 1830, to describe an outbreak of cholera.
Mass number	The mass number (symbol: A) of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus. The mass number is different for each isotope of a chemical element. We write a mass number after an element's name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. We write it as carbon-12 or 12C. Mass number is not the same as:
Mastic	Mastic ( Mastika) is a resin that comes from the mastic tree, Pistacia lentiscus. The tree grows in the Mediterranean Sea region. In pharmacy and nature shops, it is called "Arabic gum" (not to be confused with gum arabic). The resin is harvested in various places, especially the Greece island of Chios.It is a liquid when the tree first produces it. Then it dries in the sun into drops of hard resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a white, opacity gum. The flavour is bitter at first. After some chewing, it has a refreshing, slightly pine or cedar-like flavour. Mastic is used in food, medicine, and industry.
Maxi single	A maxi single is a CD single that contains more than two tracks. The first maxi-single was released during the 1970s. There are also cassette maxi singles that began in the 1990s.
Maya calendar	The Maya calendar is a system of calendars and almanacs used in the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and in some modern Maya communities in highland Guatemala. It shares many aspects with calendars employed by other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Zapotec civilisation and Olmec, and contemporary or later ones such as the Mixtec and Aztec calendars. Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements of it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.
Mazaron ke phool	Published in December 2008 by Ilm-o-Irfan Publishers, Urdu Bazaar, Lahore, Pakistan , "Mazaron Ke Phool" (Graveyard Flowers) is the only Absurd Play in history of Urdu Literature. It was written by a Pakistan academic-writer, columnist and lawyer Mujtaba Haider Zaidi, the author of "Veto Oligarchy: the Fittest Deserve Supremacy".
Medal of Aeronautics	Medal of Aeronautics () is a civil honor of the government of France. It is awarded to those who have made outstanding contributions to the aviation industry.
Media player	Media player is a word that describes computer software that can play more than one type of media (multimedia). Media players can usually play both audio (sound) and video files. Microsoft Windows comes with a media player already on it, Windows Media Player. Some other media players are Quicktime, iTunes, Real Player and Winamp.
Mediacom	Mediacom Communications is an United States cable television, internet and telephone company. It was founded in July 1995. The company serves Columbia, Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri and Springfield, Missouri, the Quad Cities of southeast Iowa and western Illinois, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa and Waterloo, Iowa in Iowa. It also serves certain areas of Minnesota, Alabama and outlying areas of the Florida Gulf Coast. It serves a total of twenty-two states. Mediacom was a publicly traded firm. It later went private. It is now owned by Commisso.<ref></ref>
Medical cannabis	Medical marijuana, aka medical cannabis, is cannabis and cannabinoids that are given by doctors to their patients. The use of marijuana as a medicine has not been tested much because it can be difficult to get enough of it to test and because of other governmental regulations. Medical cannabis can help with nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy. It can improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS. It can reduce chronic pain and muscle spasms. Short-term use makes it more likely that there will be side effects. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness and hallucinations. Long-term effects of marijuana are not clear. Concerns include memory problems, risk of addiction and children taking it by accident. The Cannabis plant has been used as medicine for thousands of years in many cultures. Its current use is controversy. Medical marijuana can be given in different ways. They include vaporizing, smoking dried buds, eating foods that have cannabis in them, taking capsules or using lozenges. Recreational use of marijuana is illegal in most parts of the world. The medical use of cannabis is legal in some countries, including the Czech Republic, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Australia is working to pass a law that will allow the use of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. In the United States, federal law says all use of marijuana is illegal. But more than 30 states and the District of Columbia no longer arrest people for having medical marijuana, as long as they follow a state's medical marijuana rules.
Medusa with the Head of Perseus	Medusa with the Head of Perseus is a statue or sculpture. Argentina artist Luciano Garbati made it in 2008. It is famous because people in the #MeToo Movement talked about it. The media called the statue an "icon of justice" for people who survived sexual assault. That happened several years after the statue was made.
Meessen De Clercq	Meessen De Clercq is a contemporary art gallery in Brussels, Belgium. The gallery is in an old building with three floors.In 2007, art historian Olivier Meessen and art lover Jan De Clercq began to work to start a contemporary art gallery in Brussels. In April 2008 the gallery opened, with a group show of works by seven artists. After this first show, the gallery closed to rebuild it. From September 2008 the gallery re-opened with group and solo shows by both older and new artists.
Meet-in-the-middle attack	The Meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptography attack which, like the birthday attack, makes use of a space-time tradeoff. While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range, the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function—quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function. It was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1977. When trying to improve the security of a block cipher, one might get the idea to simply use two independent Key (cryptography) to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme. Certainly, an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take 2^ attempts if each key is n bits long, compared to the 2^n attempts required for a single key. However, Diffie and Hellman, discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme. The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end, thus meeting in the middle. Assume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext: P and C. That is,
Meitei architecture	"Meitei architecture" or "Manipuri architecture" is the architecture, produced by the Meitei ethnicity in Ancient Manipur from the middle of the fifteenth century BC.The major architectural designs and styles include traditional Meitei Yumjao (lit. Large House), Sanglen (lit. Public House) and others.
Memorandum opinion	In law, a memorandum opinion is usually an Publishing legal opinion that cannot be cited as precedent. It is formally defined as: "[1] unanimous appellate opinion that succinctly states the decision of the court; an opinion that briefly reports the court's conclusion, usu. without elaboration because the decision follows a well-established legal principle or does not relate to any point of law." There is no or explanation because the decision either follows a well-known legal principle or it does not relate to a point of law.<ref name=uslegal/> A memorandum opinion is also not subject to appeal.<ref name=uslegal/> Generally, memorandum opinions follow ordinary rules, including the application of precedent and the rule of stare decisis.
Memorial	A memorial is an object which serves as a memory of something, usually a person who has died or a famous event. Statues are a Popularity type of memorial. A memorial hall is a building which serves to remind people of something, again usually people who have died. Memorial halls in the United Kingdom and United States are usually about World War I or World War II. Memorial halls in Germany and Poland are often about the Holocaust, when Nazi Germany killed many Jewish people. Memorial halls in PRC are usually about the Second Sino-Japanese War of World War II. An important memorial hall is the Nanjing Massacre Museum.
Memory leak	When a Computer program gets executed, it uses Random access memory. In some cases, a poorly-written program may incorrectly manage the memory that has been given to it. As a consequence, the memory that was actually supposed to be reused after the program has finished its job cannot be accessed again. This is known as a memory leak. One of the most common reasons for memory leaks is the program not giving its memory back after it has finished execution. Memory leaks may result in several issues such as degradation of Computer performance and systems being unresponsive.
Memrise	Memrise is a free online language-learning website. It uses flashcards with mnemonics to teach. Users are tested by multiple choice and type-in tests. Memrise was founded by Ed Cooke (author) and Greg Detre. Memrise is headquartered in England. Memrise uses what's called "elaborate encoding" to help users remember different concepts.
Merchet	A merchet was a fine paid on a marriage in the Middle Ages in England. When a peasant woman was to get married to someone who was not of the same manor, her lord was paid money to allow her to be married. The money was usually paid by the father of the woman. This fine was paid because when the woman became married she would leave the manor with her new husband. Because of this, the lord would lose a worker.
Messerschmitt	Messerschmitt AG was a German aircraft manufacturer. It was founded in 1916, re-founded in 1938, and named for designer Willy Messerschmitt. It was headquarted in Augsburg, Germany. It made most of the fighter planes the Germans used in World War II. They made the Bf 109 and 110 fighter plane, the Me 321 transport plane and the Me 262 "Swallow" jet fighter. Many of their plane parts were made by people from concentration camps. After the war, the company made cars, bicycles, and prefab homes. In 1969, Messerschmitt merged with Bölkow and Blohm, and today exists as EADS Germany
Metallurgy	Metallurgy is the study of metals. Alloys (mixtures of metals) are also studied. There are two main branches of Metallurgy. They are physical and chemical metallurgy. A Metallurgist is individual who researches, manufactures and develops metal items that range from car parts to Semiconductor. Metallurgists and Metallurgical Engineers often work for consulting engineering firms; mining and manufacturing companies; and in government and universities. Many metallurgists hold a Bachelor of Engineering or similar 4- year degree. Common Job Tasks
Metonic cycle	The Metonic cycle is a period of about 19 years used in astronomy and calendar studies. In particular, it is often used in the structure of lunisolar calendars, because 19 The Sun years is almost exactly the same length of time as 235 The Moon months.
Metromedia Square	Metromedia Square was a radio and television studio that was in Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood. The studio was known for having a statue of a white snake that was made out of ladders on the roof. The famous 1970s sitcom, All in the Family was made at Metromedia Square from 1975 to 1979.
Metronome	A metronome is a small device that can be used by people who are practising musical instrument to help them to play in time. It is also something a composer can use to show the performer what speed to play. A traditional metronome works by clockwork. It has a pendulum which makes a loud tick as it goes to and fro, like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. It has to be wound up after a few minutes of ticking. There is a weight on the pendulum which can be slid up or down and set to a particular speed. There are numbers on the metronome to which you can set it. These numbers mean the number of ticks per minutes. A speed of 60 will make it tick 60 times a minute (i.e. every second). The numbers usually go from 40 (slow) to 208 (very fast). Nowadays many people use electronic metronomes. These are very accurate, do not need to be wound and often have other helpful things like an A to tune to (see musical tuning). Some of them are hardly bigger than a credit card. The metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812. A man called Johann Maelzel copied Winkel’s ideas and improved them. He made a small, portable metronome which was patented in 1816. The metronome made it possible for a composer to show the performer what speed he wanted. If the composer writes at the top of his music: Crotchet (quarter note) = 76, for example, then the metronome can be set at 76 and it will tick at the right speed for that piece of music. Sometimes they write "MM76". The "MM" stands for "Maelzel's Metronome". Ludwig van Beethoven was the first composer to use metronome markings, but he often gave very fast speed indications, and some people wonder whether he made mistakes or whether his metronome worked properly.

Micro-Hydropower	A micro-hydro power (MHP) plant is a type of hydroelectric power scheme that produces electricity using a flowing stream or a water flow. Micro-hydro systems are generally used in developing countries to provide electricity to isolated communities or rural villages where electricity grid is not available. Feeding back into the national grid when electricity production is in surplus is also evident in some cases. The micro-hydro scheme design can be approached as per household basis or at the village level often involving local materials and labor
Microatoll	A microatoll is a circular Colony (biology) of corals, near the surface of the ocean. Because the top is not in the water all the time, the corals at the top are dead. The corals which are not exposed to fresh air are still alive. The atoll will only grow in the areas which are in the water all the time. Microatolls may be up to in diameter. They are named for their resemblance to Atoll formed during the subsidence of volcanic islands, as originally suggested by Darwin (1842). They have been used to monitor sea levels, in response to global warming. They have also been used to quantify and date changes in sea level in seismically active areas. Using microatolls, scientists were able to provide information about the water temperature at the surface of the sea.
Microbial mat	A microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of microorganisms, mainly bacteria and archaea. They were first described by Paracelsus (~1519),<ref name =Krum/>p1 but their full significance was not realised until the last quarter of the 20th century. Microbial mats grow mostly on submerged or moist surfaces but a few survive in deserts. They Colony (biology) environments ranging in temperature from –40 °C to +120 °C. A few are endosymbionts of animals. Although usually only a few centimetres thick, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments. They consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or tolerate the chemicals at their level. In moist conditions mats are held together by slimy substances (polysaccharides) secretion by the microorganisms.118; 1671-7 Some of the micro-organisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites, but there are also spherical forms. Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good fossil evidence, from 3500 million years ago, and were for a long period the most important members of the planet's ecosystems. Originally they may have depended on hydrothermal vents for energy and chemical "food". The development of photosynthesis gradually liberated them from the 'hydrothermal ghetto' by proving a more widely-available energy source, sunlight, although initially the photosynthesizing mats still depended on the diffusion of chemicals emitted by hydrothermal vents. The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are carbon dioxide and water. As a result microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of Cell (biology), of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant micro-organisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans. Because of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as nutrients, there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution.
Microblog	A microblog is a form of a blog where people send short messages of text or media (pictures, video, or sounds). These messages can be sent to a website and shown to either a small group or to the public. A "microblogger" (someone who uses a microblog) could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages, email, instant messaging or through a website. A microblog is usually different from a normal blog. It has much smaller pieces. A microblog entry can be just one sentence, or a link to an image or short video. A person writing a microblog can use many ideas from "what am I doing now," to Race cars or politics or information about their business or personal life.
Microcredit	A microcredit (sometimes called a micro-loan, or microloan) is a special kind of loan given to poor business people, mostly in Developing country. Microcredits were created to support entrepreneurship, and to lessen poverty. Very often, people getting a microcredit are illiterate: they cannot fill out forms to apply for a regular loan. Microcredits also work differently: the interest ot be paid is usually much higher than with a regular loan, often it is over 20%. The interest usually also has to be paid more often. Microcredits have been criticized, because people taking them often end up in a situation where they cannot repay their debt.
Microfinance	Microfinance is the idea to provide services banks and insurance company provide to those people who usually are not served by such businesses. It is an important form of development aid. Serving these people is usually very expensive for banks and insurance companies; that is why they usually do not do it. Speciaized NGOs provide these services:
Microformat	A Microformat is an attempt to re-use existing content in HTML and XML documents. Such content may be information on how to contact someone, or it may be geographical coordinates, for example. This information can then be processed by software more easily. Technically, this kind of information is already there. A microformat aims at making this information accessible more easily. That way, tags might be added to flag the information.
Milgram experiment	The Milgram experiment is the name for a number of controversial experiments in psychology. They were done by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Milgram wanted to find out how easy it was to get someone to follow orders, even if the orders went against their conscience. In his experiment, a test subject was ordered by a scientist to inflict electric shocks on another person, though the shocks were faked. To his surprise, most subjects did as they were told until the very end of the experiment, though many found it difficult. There have been many repetitions and variations of the experiment, with similar results.
Military camouflage	Camouflage is a type of clothing, fabric covering, or painted pattern used by militaries and armies to make it harder to see soldiers and weapons such as artillery guns and military vehicles. Camouflage uniform, fabric coverings, and paint use a colored pattern of several colors that is designed to blend in with the surroundings. Camouflage patterns are also used for hunting clothes.
Milk Marketing Board	The Milk Marketing Board was an agency of the British government. The Board bought all of the milk in England and Wales from dairy farmers and passed it on to be processed and sold. This way small farmers always got a fair price, because no big producer could sell their milk more cheaply. The Board was first set up in 1933. In 1933 and 1934 three other boards were set up for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland in 1955. From 1958 until it was abolished the Milk Marketing Board sponsored (paid money for) the Tour of Britain bicycle race, which was called "The Milk Race".
Mimicry	In biology, mimicry is when a species Evolution features similar to another. Either one or both are protected when a third species cannot tell them apart. Often, these features are vision; one species looks like another; but similarities of sound, smell and behaviour may also make the fraud seem more real. Mimicry is related to camouflage, and to Warning colouration, in which species manipulate or deceive other species which might do them harm. Although mimicry is mainly a defence against predators, sometimes predators also use mimicry, and fool their prey into feeling safe. Mimicry happens in both animal and plant species. The mimic is the species which looks like the model. The model may be living, or not. Whole groups of animals go in for mimicry as a life style, such as mantids, leaf insects or stick insects. Camouflage, in which a species looks similar to its surroundings, is a form of visual mimicry. There are far more insect mimics than any other Class (biology) of animal, Many other kinds of animal mimics are known, including fish, plants and even fungi, though less research has been done on these. Mimicry evolution because the species that are better at mimicking survive to produce more than the species that are worse at mimicking. The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species. Over time, mimic species get closer to their models. This is the process of evolution by natural selection.
Mind	The mind is a general term for the way a person that opinion, logic, perceives, wills, has ideas, and emotion. For science, what others call the mind is entirely caused by workings of the brain. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle called mind the "Ghost in the Machine". He said the idea that it was separate from the brain was the mistaken "Official Doctrine". However, some think that mind is separate from the body and is called a soul (see dualism). Many people argue about what makes up the mind. Some say that only reason and memory are part of the mind, because they are conscious. In this view the emotions like love, hate, fear and happiness are different from the mind. Some people with this view say the emotions are part of the heart. Others argue that our and emotional states cannot be separated and should all be part of what we call the mind. People often use mind to mean the same as thought: the way we talk to ourselves "inside our heads". This is where the sayings "make up our minds," "change our minds" and "of two minds" come from. One of the important things of the mind in this sense is that it is private. No one else can "know our mind."
Mind control	Mind control (also known as brainwashing, coercive persuasion or thought control) refers to the way some people have tried to control the beliefs and behaviours of others. It is a process where a group or individual uses methods to persuade other to change their basic beliefs and values. A group or individual may use unethical methods to persuade others to believe and do what the manipulator(s) want. It often harms the person being manipulated. The term has been applied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which undermines (damages) an individual's control over their own thinking, behaviour, emotions or decision making. Theories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how totalitarian regimes appeared to succeed systematically in indoctrinating prisoners of war through propaganda and torture techniques.
Mindset	A mindset is a state that usually a majority of people would have in a particular time or occasion. It is formed from things that people are convinced about. It is like a collected norm. Mindset can also be about how people see their abilities. In this sense, people have two types of mindsets: fixed and growth mindsets. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that students with fixed mindset believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed characteristics . They have a certain amount and they improve, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and working hard. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.
Mini-skirt	The mini-skirt, or miniskirt, is a skirt well above the knees, close to the buttocks. If the top and skirt are all-in-one, then it is a minidress. Microskirts are extremely brief, and usually worn only for publicity events. Mini-skirts were invented by Mary Quant, who also invented, or promoted, hot pants. There is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first; some say André Courrèges or John Bates (designer). The short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women: the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style. In Quant's case, she gave it the name. Mary Quant named the mini-skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini. She loved the car so much, she had one designed especially for her.
Minor (law)	A minor is a person under age of majority, drinking age, voting age or age of consent. They are also called underage. The age of majority depends on jurisdiction, though it is usually 18. Minor may be also used for other reasons. For example, in most of the United States, it is against the law for anyone 20 and under to drink or have alcoholic beverages, such as beer. In Australia, Ireland and United Kingdom, the drinking age is 18. In Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, anyone under age 20 is a minor unless emancipated.
Minute	A minute is a customary unit of time. It is equal to 60 seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour. Unlike the second, the minute is not an SI unit. A minute is also of a degree (geometry). In this context, a minute is also called an arcminute, and is written with the ' symbol. For example, the Sun and Moon both have angular diameters of about 30 arcminutes—when seen from Earth.
Mitigating circumstances	Mitigating circumstances are factors that can decrease a sentence in a lawsuit. Examples of mitigating circumstances are: being young, not having a previous record, being mentally ill, etc...
Mixotroph	A mixotroph is an organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon. Usually this means that it may be either autotroph or heterotroph at different times in its life. Also possible are alternations between photo- and chemotrophy, or between litho- and organotrophy. Mixotrophs can be either eukaryotes or prokaryotes.
Mobile app	A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. Apps are usually available through an app store for that Computing platform. These began appearing in 2008. The largest stores are operated by the owner of the Operating system. Some apps are usually bundled with the device, already installed before you buy it. Other apps may be downloaded for free from the app store, and some must be purchased. Software developers make as they make other computer programs, and usually offer them through the app store.
Mod Archive	The Mod Archive is a website that is an archive and index of music module files. Anyone can upload music module files to the website, and the community makes charts, reviews and ratings of them. The website covers these formats: MOD (file format), IT (file format), XM (file format), AHX, OctaMED, Scream Tracker, S3M, MO3, MTM, 669, AMF, AMS, DBM, DIGI, DMF, DSM, FAR, GDM, IMF, J2B, MDL, OpenMPT#MPTM_file_format, MT2, OKT, PLM, PTM, STM, ULT and HVL.
Model (person)	A model is a person who has the job of using their body to pose for art, or to show fashion items, such as clothes or jewellery. Models often appear in advertising on television and in print media, for example newspapers and magazines, or on the Internet.
Modern language	A modern language is a language which is spoken today. It is the opposite of an extinct language. The official languages of countries are modern languages.
Modernism	Modernism was a culture of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama. Modernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory.
Modernist literature	Modernist literature is the literary form of modernism. It does not mean "modern" in the sense of recent in time. Literary modernism has its origins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly in Europe and North America. Modernism is characterized by a break with traditional styles of poetry and verse. Modernists experimented with literary form and expression. Ezra Pound's maxim was "Make it new". The horrors of the First World War had an effect. Thinkers such as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx were influential.<ref name="MORLEY2012"/> Modernist literature was at its height from 1900 to 1940, and featured such authors as Knut Hamsun, Vladimir Nabokov, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Franz Kafka, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, Andrei Bely, W.B. Yeats, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Gertrude Stein, Samuel Beckett, Menno ter Braak, Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, Mikhail Bulgakov, Robert Frost and Boris Pasternak.
Modesty	Modesty (also called demureness or reticence) is the term for certain norms of behaviour, clothing and habits a society expects from its people. Excessive modesty is sometimes called prudery. Modesty usually includes:
Moirang Sai	"Moirang Sai" () is a story telling art form of Manipur that narrates the epic love story of the Khamba Thoibi of Ancient Moirang, a province in Ancient Manipur. Currently, it is dying among the present generation of the Manipuri ethnicity. Recently, Mangka Mayanglambam, a legendary folk singer, is reviving the nearly extinct music art form.After her dedicated efforts, there have been consecutive workshops organized to preserve the age old tradition by many organizations and associations of Manipur.
Mole (unit)	Mole is the SI unit used to measure how many molecules or atoms there are. One mole is around 600 sextillion molecules. Scientists use this number because 1 gram of hydrogen is around 1 mole of atoms. The exact value of one mole is . This number comes from experiments with carbon because it's easy to work with. is also called Avogadro's number, which was named after the person who invented it. Anything can be measured in moles, but it is not practical for most tasks because the value is so massive. For example, one mole of grapefruits would be as big as the earth. Because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass, one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else. Atoms and molecule mass is measured in atomic mass unit. One amu is equal to one gram per mole. This means that if an atom has a mass of one amu, one mole of this atom weighs one gram.
Monoculture	Monoculture is growing a single crop in a large area. Farmers decide what is the best crop, and grow only that. This is very common in modern agriculture, as it simplifies the farm and allows relatively few people to harvest large amounts. Monocultures have problems, however: Pests and diseases that attack only one kind of plant can spread more easily when they only find that kind. Each kind of plant also needs particular nutrients from the soil. Fertilizers are used to supply that nutrient. Farmers who don't understand farming may ruin their farm. One example of a monoculture is the cavendish banana.
Monologue	A monologue is a long, uninterrupted Oratory or poem by one person. The person may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud or directly addressing other persons, e.g. an audience, a character, reader, or inanimate object. The term 'dramatic monologue' is used both for monologues in plays and for the Dramatic monologue.
Monophthong	A monophthong (pronounced "Mono-F-thong") is simply a vowel. The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language. Mono means one or single, and the -phthong means sound or tone, from the basic word phthalein, which means to speak, create sound with the voice. The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position. For example, when you say "teeth", then while you are creating the sound of the "ee", nothing changes for that sound. A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable. There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong.
Monte dei Paschi di Siena	Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (sometimes referred to as BMPS or MPS) claims to be the oldest surviving retail bank in the world. It has its headquarters in Siena, Italy. The company's website claims that the bank was founded in the year 1472, although there is little information to confirm this.
Moon landing	A Moon landing is the of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. It is a follow up to Project Mercury. This includes both crewed and Unmanned aerial vehicle (robotic) . The first object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959. The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. There have been List of Apollo missions#Crewed that landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. There were also numerous landings without people onboard, with no Soft landing (rocketry) happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013. To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully landed humans on the Moon. The last mission was in December, 1972, and the last human to walk on the Moon was Gene Cernan.
Morality	Morality is the concept of doing the right thing. Morals are basic guidelines for living. Many people have written about ways of choosing what the right thing is. Some believe that there is an Objectivity (philosophy) (true even if you do not agree with it) morality, often thinking it was set by God or another similar being; others think that morality is subjective (that what is good or bad is a community choice). People can learn morals from religion, parents, friends, school, books, or from ethical traditions. People that teach or follow morals are called moralists. It can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story. It is usually one line at the end of the story ("The moral of this story is....."). Fables are stories with a moral. The opposite of "moral" is "immoral", meaning the wrong thing to do. "Amoral" means something that is not related to morality, or has no morally good or bad aspect to it. It is the same as "morally neutral". Morality means that you can tell between a right and a wrong thing.
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management	Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is an American Multinational corporation financial services corporation specializing in Broker. It is the wealth & asset management division of Morgan Stanley. In the late 1980s the retail brokerage firm Smith Barney was owned by Primerica Financial Services. Commercial Credit purchased Primerica in 1988, for $1.5 billion. In 1992, they paid $722 million to buy a 27 percent share of Travelers Insurance. By the end of 1993, the merged company was known as Travelers Group Inc. In September 1997, Travelers acquired Salomon Inc. (parent company of Salomon Brothers Inc.), for over $9 billion in stock, and merged it with its own investment arm to create Salomon Smith Barney. In April 1998 Travelers Group announced an agreement to undertake a $76 billion merger between Travelers and Citicorp, creating the largest single financial services company in the world. On January 13, 2009, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup announced that Citigroup would sell 51% of Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley, creating Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which was formerly a division of Citi Global Wealth Management. The combined brokerage house has 17,649 financial advisors and manages $2 trillion in client assets.
Moroccan architecture	Moroccan architecture includes various structures built during different time periods. from the first Berberians settlers from the south and through the Arab invastion from the east and the European conquest that came from the north. The most notable style in this country is the Berberian Architecture that existed initially, followed by the style of local Islamic architecture that shaped the local style that came after the Arabs entered.
Mosaic	Mosaic is the art of decorating a surface with pictures and patterns made of little pieces of stone, glass or tiles of different colours. Mosaics can be used indoors on walls, floors and ceilings. Mosaics are sometimes used outdoors on pavements.
Motif	In art, a motif is a repeated pattern, image, or theme. Paisley (design) are called motifs. Many designs in mosques in Islamic culture are motifs. Two major Roman motifs are egg and tongue, and ball and reel. Motifs may have iconographic significance within a work of art.
Motivation	Motivation is an important part of human psychology. It arouses a person to act towards a desired goal. It is a driving force which promotes action. For example, hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat. "Motivation is an energizer of behavior".<ref name=Reber/> is the purpose or psychological cause of an action.<ref name=Schacter/> With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs: needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, needs to escape pain and threats... The drive to do these things is instinctive, inborn, and triggered by circumstance. With humans, whose mental life is so much more complex, motivation is more complicated. Obviously, humans feel the need for food and water, avoid pain and so on. But they are also capable of having long-term plans which are more difficult to understand.
Motor soft starter	A motor soft starter is a device used in an electric motor to smooth out the starting of the motor. This is done by lowering the electrical load, torque and electric current.
Motor–generator	A motor–generator is a device for converting electricity to another form. Motor–generator sets are used to convert frequency, voltage, or Three-phase electric power of power. They may also be used to isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor–generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor–generators were used to convert battery (electricity) power to higher voltages. Nowadays, motor–generators have largely been replaced by semiconductor devices. Examples include rectifiers for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and inverters for converting DC to AC.
Mozilla Thunderbird	Mozilla Thunderbird is a free software cross-platform e-mail client developed by the Mozilla Foundation.
Muff	A muff is a tube made of fur or other warm material into which the hands are placed for warmth. They are rarely used today. Changes in fashion might be one reason. Also, vehicles which transport people today are usually heated.
Multialphabetism	Multialphabetism more than one alphabet being used and can be for different reasons:
Music of Africa	The traditional music of Africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich and diverse, with different regions and nations of Africa having many distinct musical traditions. Music in Africa is very important when it comes to religion. Songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.
Music session	A music session (also called a jam session or simply session) is a gathering of musicians to make music together. It can be a social gathering, or a Live music performance where the music is played for an audience. A suitable venue might be a local hotel, public bar or private home.
Music stand	A music stand is something musicians can use to put sheet music on when they are performing. There are several different sorts of music stand, but almost all of them can be adjusted in height so that they can be used by tall or short players, and by players whether they are sitting down or standing up. The most popular type of music stand is the metal one that can be folded up so that it is easy to carry about. Some music stands are made of wood. These are sometimes very and therefore quite . Orchestras usually give their players very heavy metal music stands. This is because the light, fold-up ones are easily knocked over. It is also very difficult to write on music on a fold-up metal stand because there is nothing to press against (in rehearsals musicians often have to write fingering, bowing (music) and other markings in the sheet music). There are also very small music stands that do not have legs and are designed to be put on a table. These can be used for any kind of instrument that can be played sitting at a table. There are also small ones that can be attached to the instrument itself. These are used in marching bands. Thomas Jefferson, former president of the United States, invented a revolving music stand which he never patented because he wanted people to be able to use his invention for free. There are also digital music stands. When the violin Tasmin Little played the LigetiViolin Concerto at a BBC Proms in 2003 she used a special, computer music stand that had been made for her. There were no gaps in the music where she could have turned the pages of an ordinary music score. Instead, the music was on a computer screen, and she moved to the next page by pressing a pedal with her foot. There was also another pedal for turning back a page which was important to have when practising and for rehearsal.
Musicology	Musicology means the study of music by a scholar. A scholar is an academic person, often a professor or lecturer at a university. Someone who studies musicology is a Musicologist. Musicologists study all kinds of music. They study the history of music and learn about all the composers and how they developed their ideas and learned from one another. They can do this by studying sheet music, or by looking for historical documents which tell us about musicians from the past. Musicologists may also study the philosophy of music (thinking about what music means). They write articles in musical journals or books on music. This can help us to know and understand more about the music we play or listen to.
Mutual fund	A mutual fund is a kind of investment that uses money from investors to invest in stocks, Bond (finance) or other types of investment. A fund manager (or "portfolio manager") decides how to invest the money, and for this he is paid a fee, which comes from the money in the fund. Mutual funds are usually "open ended", meaning that new investors can join into the fund at any time. When this happens, new units, which are like Share (finance), are given to the new investors. There are thousands of different kinds of mutual funds, specializing in investing in different countries, different types of businesses, and different investment styles. There are even some funds that only invest in other funds.
Mutual intelligibility	Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are alike. This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different Language or different Dialect. There are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and Orthography between British English and American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible. Sometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani language, the official language of British India until India became Independence. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu. Also, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many Native speaker of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin Chinese, Wu Chinese, and Cantonese language in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other. These examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for Linguistics, or people who study languages as their job. When a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese language and Spanish language. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages.
My Computer	My Computer is seen on the Microsoft Microsoft Windows computers. My Computer allows the user to access the local Computer drive, such as the local disk, also known as the C: Drive. The user can also access external drives. Examples of an external drive are a floppy disk drive (A: Drive) and the Compact disc Drive (D:). My computer also lets the user access My Documents and other files.Whenever any external drive is attached to the computer, the user can directly access that drive from My Computer menu. "My Computer" gives us an overview about different types of drives present in the computer. The My Computer folder is a gateway to all the data stored on the computer, attached devices, and the network -- as well as a shortcut to most of your system information.
My Grandfather's Clock	"My Grandfather's Clock" is a song. Henry Clay Work wrote it in 1876. Henry Clay Work also wrote "Marching Through Georgia". British brass bands and colliery bands play "My Grandfather's Clock". Bluegrass musicians also play it. The Oxford English Dictionary says the word "grandfather clock" comes from this song. Before that, grandfather clocks were called "longcase clocks". In 1905, Harry Macdonough and the Haydn Quartet (known then as the "Edison Quartet") made the first recording of this song that people know about.
Myco-heterotrophy	Myco-heterotrophy is a relationship between certain plants and fungi. The plant gets all or part of its food from parasitism on fungi, not from photosynthesis. In the past, non-photosynthetic plants were thought to get food by breaking down organic matter like fungi do. Such plants were therefore called "Saprotroph". That was wrong. It is now known that no plant is physiology capable of direct breakdown of organic matter. To get food, non-photosynthetic plants engage in parasitism, by myco-heterotrophy or direct parasitism of other plants. The interface between the plant and fungal partners in this association is between the roots of the plant and the mycelium of the fungus. Myco-heterotrophy therefore closely resembles mycorrhiza, and is thought to have evolved from mycorrhiza.
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator	The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a set of questions based on psychology. By answering the questions, people can learn about how they tend to make choices. They can also learn about how they view the world. After answering the questions in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, people are placed in one of sixteen groups. These groups are based on theories by Carl Gustav Jung in his book Psychological Types (1921). Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers created the first set of questions during World War II. The set of questions was made to help women who were working for the first time. Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyers thought that the set of questions would help women be happier and work better. The set of questions has grown into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The MBTI that we use today was created in 1962. Though there are sixteen types, it is stated that there is no best type. The types are considered all equal.
Möbius strip	The Möbius strip or Möbius band is a looped surface with only one side and only one edge. It can be made using a strip of paper by gluing the two ends together with a half-twist. The twisting is possible in two directions; so there are two different (mirror-image) Möbius strips. The Mobius strip is known for its unusual properties. A bug crawling along the center line of the loop would go around twice before coming back to its starting point. Cutting along the center line of the loop creates one longer band, not two. Cutting one third of the way in from the edge (and parallel to it) produces two Möbius strips, looped together. The Möbius strip was discovered independently by the Germany mathematicians August Ferdinand Möbius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858.
N (Poland)	N was an Poland independent television-radio digital platform launched on October 12, 2006 and closed on March 21, 2013,<ref name=:2/> owned by ITI, the member of TVN Group. As at December 31, 2011, the company's services were used by 929,000 subscribers. On March 21, 2013, the company was merged with Cyfra+ to form Platforma Canal+.
NATO phonetic alphabet	The NATO phonetic alphabet is a way of using words to replace letters. The first letter of the word is the letter the word stands for. Although it is called a "phonetic alphabet" it is not really used for phonetics like the International Phonetic Alphabet or other phonetic alphabets. It is used to clearly say Latin alphabet out loud when they might be hard to hear such as over the phone or when people are talking from different countries, or when it is important to be accurate such as in the military and in aviation. There have been many different phonetic alphabets over time. On board ships, flags are used to stand for letters, and each have their own meanings. Different countries also have different phonetic alphabets used in any subject
NBC Studios (New York City)	NBC Studios are in the historic 30 Rockefeller Plaza (on Sixth Avenue (Manhattan) between 49th and 50th streets) in the borough (New York City) of Manhattan, New York City. The building has the NBC television network headquarters, its Parent company NBCUniversal, and NBC's flagship (television) WNBC (Channel 4). It also has the United States cable news MSNBC.
NTFS	NTFS is a file system developed by Microsoft. NTFS stands for New Technology File System. A file system is a way of storing computer files. Microsoft introduced it with the Windows NT operating system. It was made to replace the old file-system used by earlier versions of Windows, like Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98SE. That file system was also used by MS-DOS and is called File Allocation Table. A newer version of NTFS (v3.1) was used in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and the most recent version of operating system, Windows 10. NTFS can be accessed from non-Windows operating systems such as Linux using the NTFS-3G driver.
Nadir	In astronomy, the nadir is a point "below" a particular location. "Below" means in the same direction of gravity at that location. The nadir is the opposite of the zenith. The nadir is not a real point. It is used as a reference for the location of other things.
Naked eye	If you can see something with the naked eye, it means that you can see things without using a microscope, binoculars, eyeglasses or a telescope. In astronomy a naked-eye object is something, such as a star, that the general public can see without using these tools.
Name tag	A name tag is a badge or sticker worn on the outermost clothing as a means of displaying the wearer's name for others to view.
Naming rights	Naming rights is the term used when a company pays money to the owners of a stadium or other sports venue, to have that stadium named for the company. An example is the baseball park called Coors Field. This is done by a legal contract, usually for a limited number of years. "Naming rights" is also called Corporate sponsorship.
Napoleonic Code	The Napoleonic Code ‒ or Code Napoléon, officially the Code civil des Français ‒ is the France Civil law established under Napoleon in 1804. Four judges wrote the Code for Napoleon, to replace the many different kinds of law in different places. It did not allow Privilege (social inequality) based on birth (such as nobility), established equality before the law and secured the right to property. It allowed freedom of religion.<ref name=Miller283/> It also set up a system of Civil service where government jobs would go to the most qualified.<ref name=Miller283/> Due to the Napoleonic Wars the Napoleonic code became an influence on most of Europe. In particular, it influenced countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Latin American countries, the province of Quebec and the state of Louisiana in the United States. It influenced all other former French Colony which base their civil law systems on the Napoleonic Code. The code of 1804:
Narcissism	Narcissism is a condition in which a person admires their own attributes through vanity or egotism. The term is derived from Narcissus (mythology), a figure from classical mythology who fell in love with the sight of his own face.
Narcissistic parent	The term narcissistic parent refers to parents who are affected by narcissism. They are almost exclusively close to and possessive about their children. The parents are especially envious regarding their child growing to independence. In other words, narcissistic parents often feel senses of losses when their children grow to adulthood. The parents carry self-esteem problems and extreme needs regarding how others may look at or regard them. Children are often punished very strongly if narcissistic parents are not responded to in adequacy. The behavior of such parents is not flexible, and they have an inability to admit to their own fault or feel sympathy and empathy.
National Association of Broadcasters	The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is a trade association and lobbying representing the interests of commercial and non-commercial over-the-air radio and television broadcastings in the United States. The NAB represents more than 8,300 radio and television tsations as well as broadcast networks. As of 2015, the president and CEO of the NAB is Gordon Smith (politician), a former United States Senator from Oregon. The NAB was founded as the National Association of Radio Broadcasters (NARB) in April 1923 at the Drake Hotel (Chicago) in Chicago.
National Building Museum	The National Building Museum is a museum in Washington D.C. dedicated to architecture, landscaping, urban design, urban planning, industrial design, and the history of buildings in the United States. The museum host exhibitions of architectural styles and organizes tours for visitors and activities for children and families. The museum was established in 1969 by architect Beverly Willis and moved to an old building that was the Interior of the Pension Office in 1980.
National Center for Missing & Exploited Children	National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a private and nonprofit organization. United States Congress established the organization in mid-June 1984. The chairperson of this organization is the child safety advocacy Patty Wetterling, the mother of murder of Jacob Wetterling, an eleven-year-old-boy who was murdered in Minnesota in October 1989. The NCMEC handle cases of missing or exploited children between when they're baby and young adulthood through age 20. The Center not only advocates for finding missing children, teenagers or young adults, it helps identify the dead.
National memorial	A National memorial is a designation in a country or a nation for an officially recognized area that memorializes a historic person or certain event respectively.
Native (ecology)	A species is called indigenous or native to a when that species lives there because of the natural environment, not human change. A species is an indigen if it lives in the wild and has not had artificial selection by humans. If a species is in a place because it was moved by humans, the species is not indigenous to that place. It is an introduced species.
Native speaker	A native speaker is someone who learned to speak a language as part of their childhood development. A native speaker's language is usually the language their parents speak and/or the language of their country of origin. It is the only language of a monolingual person, and likely the first language of a multilingual person which is acquired naturally in their native environment. It may serve as the basis for their sociolinguistic identity. A native speaker of a language has the following traits:
Natural capital	Natural capital is a metaphor for the mineral, plant, and animal formations of the Earth's biosphere when viewed as a means of production of oxygen, water filter, erosion preventer, or provider of other ecosystem services. In a traditional economics analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be understood as "land (economics)" and therefore something else than "capital (economics)" in its original sense. At the beginning of reflection about economics "land" was seen as something natural, but "capital (economics)" as man-made Good (economics) only. But the benefits which humans have from nature are many. 17 of them were closely looked at by Robert Costanza. These benefits are in some ways similar to those that owners of "capital (economics)" have as their capital produces more goods, e.g. a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples. This is an approach to ecosystem valuation, an alternative to the traditional view of all non-human life as passive natural resources. But human knowledge and understanding of the natural environment is never complete, and therefore we cannot yet know what natural capital means exactly.
Natural language	A natural language is the kind which we use in everyday conversation and writing. For example English language, Hindi, Chinese language. Natural languages are always very flexible, and people speak them in slightly different ways. There are some natural languages which are simplified, such as Basic English and Special English. An artificial language is quite different, as it is built for some special purpose. They are always very precise, and must be used according to pre-set rules. Symbolic logic, mathematics, programming languages.
Natural person	In Law, a natural person is a real human being in contrast to an legal entity, meaning an organization that the law treats for some purposes as if it were a person distinct from its members or owner. For example, the right to vote is given to natural persons only. That is the case for most of the human rights. Therefore, obviously a corporation cannot hold public office, but it can file a lawsuit. Although science fiction has long fantasized about the possibility of sentient robots (e.g. Android (robot)s) living among humans (such as Robin Williams Bicentennial Man), no court has yet dealt with the question of whether such a being would be considered a natural person.
Naturalism (literature)	Naturalism was a 19th century literary movement. It was a development of the realism movement. Realism attempted to show subjects as they actually were, ly and naturally. Naturalism added scientific elements such as environment and heredity to fictional characters. Unlike realism, naturalism used characters who were of the lower es. It was also known for Theme (narrative) including taboo and violence. Émile Zola was the best-known writer of the literary school of naturalism. He was joined by other writers such as Gustave Flaubert, and Alphonse Daudet.
Nature's services	Nature's services is a term for the ways in which nature benefits humans. It means particularly those benefits that can be measured in economics terms. Robert Costanza and other theorists of natural capital analysed nature's services to human race in the 1990s. The economic contribution of seventeen of Ecosystem services they calculated to be about US$33 trillion per year, greater than the activities of the whole human economy, which was about US$25 trillion.This was based on estimated costs of replacing the services nature provides. For that purpose they were compared with equivalent services that are produced by humans. This calculation makes clear that mankind cannot develop without nature's services. This study is central for the theory of natural capital. But this study had no great influence on government policy or on World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund or G8 economic and trade policy.
Naval Aviation	Naval Aviation is the air force branch of a navy. Its equipment is composed of both aircraft and helicopter.
Need	A need is a thing that, when a living being, plant or animal does not have it, it is not able to live.A thing that someone wants to have, but is able to live when they do not have it, is called a want. Every person has the same basic needs for the body.Humans have bodily needs of water, food, clothing, and shelter to live.The need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly when they do not have drinking water. In a warm place food is the next most important need.In a cold place, the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die when they do not have these. Other human needs are not so certain. They are mostly needs for the mind. It is often said that a person needs love, family, and friends. These needs are for personal Interpersonal relationship. They may also be wants. It is true that a life may be better with these things, but some friends can be bad, or bad sometimes. Good relationships can make life very happy. Thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy. Some of the Research of philosophy is about questions like "What are the needs of a human?" Some scientists study the needs of human or animal minds and bodies. The study of the mind is called psychology - words about the mind. The study of bodily needs is part of medicine.
Needham-Schroeder protocol	The Technical terminology Needham-Schroeder protocol can refer to one of two communications protocol intended for use over an insecure network, both protocols designed by Roger Needham and Michael Schroeder.<ref name="needham-schroeder"></ref> The two protocols are:
Negligence	In law, negligence is a kind of lawsuit that people and organizations can bring if they are hurt. It is a kind of tort. The law calls someone negligent if he hurts someone else, or someone else's property, because he was not careful enough. In a legal case about negligence, the person who brings the lawsuit is called the plaintiff and the person who is being sued is called the defendant.
Neilsen rating	Nielsen ratings is an audience measurement system that was developed by the Nielsen Company. They created the system in an effort to determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States. The Nielsen Media Research was founded by Arthur Nielsen. Nielsen was a market analyst and began his career in the 1920s. He expanded his career into the radio market analysis during the 1930s. This helped give ratings of radio programing which was meant to provide statistics as to the markets of radio shows. In 1950, Nielsen moved to television and developed ratings systems using the methods he and his company had developed for radios.
Neoclassicism music	Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth-century. Mostly between the two World Wars. This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotions. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development. They were France and Germany. Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement. Many composers normally do not think of themselves as "neoclassicists." But some really do have some elements of the style.
Neologism	Neologism is a word that is new (15 to 20 years or less) but older and used more than a protologism. Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. (Greek language: a "new word", or the act of creating a new word) is a synonym for it. The term neologism was first used in English in 1772, borrowed from French néologisme (1734). Using an existing word or phrase in a new context is also called neologism. The process of using a word in such a new context is sometimes called a semantic extension. A new word that has not been used by anyone but the inventer is a protologism.
Neopronoun	Neopronoun or neo-pronoun, neolanguage in some idioms, is a form of gender-neutral Grammatical person pronoun neologism, used in place of he, she, It (pronoun), [[:en:One (pronoun)|one pronoun]] and singular they, specially used by some Non-binary gender. Examples of neopronouns are thon/thons, xe/xem and zie/hir. Neopronouns that are based on nouns are called nounself pronouns, such as fae/faer, moss/mossself, bun/bunself, moth/mothself, and rot/rotself. [[:en:Spivak pronouns|Spivak pronouns]] are based on they/them, such as ey/em and ae/aer.
Nernst equation	Nernst Equation is a Science equation used to find the Reduction (chemistry) Potential energy or voltage of an Electrochemistry cell. It is widely used in cell physiology and Neuroscience. It is named after [[:en:Walther_Nernst|Walther Nernst]]. He was a Germany chemist who created this equation. This equation can be used to check which combination of Chemical substance will be suitable to construct a powerful electric cell.
Net Nanny	Net Nanny is a Parental control software created by Gordon Ross in 1995 that allows parents to monitor and control their children's phones, tablets, and PCs.
Net neutrality	Net neutrality (also network neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally. There should be no discriminating or charging differently by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003. It was an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier. Examples of net neutrality violations include when the Internet service provider Comcast intentionally slowed peer-to-peer communications. In 2007, one other company was using deep packet inspection to discriminate against peer-to-peer, File Transfer Protocol, and online games. They started using a cell-phone-style billing system of overages, free-to-telecom value-added services, and bundling.
NetBackup	Veritas Software' NetBackup is a Information backup software for Microsoft Windows and Linux.
Network Functions Virtualization	Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a computer communication technology that proposes to substitute specialized network Computer hardware with Computer software running on regular computers or cloud computing. It aims to reduce costs and complexity in network, while facilitating faster creation of new communication services.
Network address translation	In computer networking, network address translation (NAT) is a technique of modifying the network address information in the Internet Protocol headers while transferring the packet across a traffic router; such a technique remaps a given address space into another address space. This allows multiple computers to share a single public IP address, which has become necessary because there are IPv4 address shortage for every computer in the world. Today, NAT is used to hide networks (called network masquerading) or to hide IP (called IP masquerading). Masquerading is the mechanism that hides an entire address space, usually consisting of private network addresses (RFC 1918), behind a single IP address usually in the public domain address space. The NAT mechanism is implemented inside a router that keeps track of the state of the network connections. The NAT device may also implement a Firewall (networking). The router uses translation tables to map the "hidden" addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing Internet Protocol on exit from the router so that they appear to originate from the router. In the reverse communications path, responses to the outgoing packets are mapped back to the originating IP address using the reverse of the rules ("state") stored in the translation tables. The outgoing Internet Protocol establish the device translation tables. The translation table rules established in the above way are cleared after a short period without new traffic refreshing their state. However, most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure translation tables’ entries for permanent use. This feature is often referred to as "static NAT" or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the 'outside' network to reach selected hosts in the masqueraded network. Carrier-grade NAT, also called large-scale NAT, is NAT done by the Internet service provider (ISP). This is used when the ISP has more customers than IP addresses. This is commonly used by cellular service providers on 3G and 4G networks, but it is not (yet) common on landline DSL or cable connections. The CIDR address block 100.64.0.0/10 is reserved for carrier-grade NAT, although many ISPs improperly use RFC 1918 private addresses, which are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. NAT is used only in IPv4. It is not necessary in IPv6, because IPv6 has enough addresses for every computer in the world to have a global address.
Neusis construction	The neusis is a geometric construction method that was used by ancient Greek mathematicians. At that time, people did not have good rules to measure distances. They did not know algebra. So, they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper.
Next of kin	A person's next of kin (NOK) is that person's closest living blood relative or relatives. Some countries, such as the United States, have a legal definition of "next of kin". In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, "next of kin" may have no legal definition and may not necessarily refer to blood relatives at all. In some legal systems, rights regarding inheritance (which imply a decision-making capacity such as in a medical emergency in which no clear will or instructions have been given, and the person has no spouse) flow to the closest relative (regardless of the age, with a representative appointed if a minor), usually a child, a parent or a sibling. However, there are people without any close adult relatives and, in such a case, decision-making power often flows to a niece or nephew, first cousin, aunt or uncle, or grandparent. For example, if a person dies intestate, the laws of some jurisdictions require distribution of the estate to the deceased's spouse or children. However, if there are none of them, the estate can often be distributed to the next closest group of living relatives, whether they are parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts and uncles, or second cousins in extreme cases. If a person dies intestate with no identifiable next of kin, the person's estate generally escheats (i.e., legally reverts) to the government. In cases of medical emergency, if a person is incapable (because of age or mental infirmity, or they are unconscious) of making decisions for themselves and they have no spouse or children, the next of kin may participate in medical decisions made by medical personnel, subject to the specific laws of the jurisdiction. The inability of persons who are not in a legal marriage to make decisions with respect to the care of a live-in partner has resulted in many jurisdictions giving live-in partners rights equivalent to a spouse in such situations, even though most jurisdictions still do not require non-spouses to be made beneficiaries of estates (it is improper in most jurisdictions to disinherit a spouse). The inability of same-sex partners to have rights with respect to a partner's medical care or funeral arrangements over and above those of the next-of-kin is one of the main reasons behind litigation to require same-sex marriage or its equivalent. For the purposes of next of kin, adopted children are treated as blood relatives. However, relatives by marriage are never considered next of kin.
Nightmare	A nightmare is a very powerful dream that the sleeper finds disturbing or frightening. Nightmares usually have either Human body causes, like a high fever, or Psychology ones, like trauma or in the sleeper's life. Nightmares are common, but nightmares that happen very often can cause problems with sleep. They may cause people to get medical help. Nightmares usually happen during REM sleep.
Nitrogen cycle	The nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organism[s]. Air is about 78% nitrogen. Nitrogen chemicals are needed for life. Nitrogen is a necessary part of proteins, DNA, and RNA. In plants, nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth. However, living things cannot use the elemental nitrogen in the air for these things. Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air (N2) into forms that can be used by life. Most nitrogen fixation is done by microorganisms called bacteria. These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N2 with hydrogen gas (H2) to make ammonia (NH3). Some of these bacteria live in the roots of plants (mostly legumes). In these roots, they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates. Other plants take nitrogen Chemical compound out of the soil through their roots. All nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants. Ammonium (NH4) in soil is made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and decomposers, bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts. This process is called ammonification. Ammonium has a positive charge. It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil. Ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals. Sewage and other waste-water is regularly measured because of this. If ammonia levels are too high, nitrification must happen. Nitrification is the oxidation of ammonia and ammonium to nitrite (NO2−) and then to nitrate ( NO3−) by bacteria. Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation. High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for baby and can cause blue-baby syndrome. High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools. This eutrophication can be harmful to fish and other water animals. The use of fertilizers is controlled because of this. Where there is no oxygen, some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas (N2) to extract energy. This starts the nitrogen cycle over again. This process is called denitrification.
Nitrogen fixation	Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen in the air (N2) is changed (converted) into ammonia () or other nitrogenous compounds in the soil. Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because nitrogen compounds are needed for making all nitrogen-containing organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Atmospheric nitrogen is a relatively unreactive molecule. It is useless to all except a few bacteria and archaea. Biological nitrogen fixation converts into ammonia, which is used (metabolized) by most organisms. Nitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways:
Nmap	Nmap is a computer program that is used for port scanning (finding out all the ways a computer communication with other computers on a network). It was written by Gordon Lyon. It can also do other kinds of scanning. This is because Nmap is open source, so many people can help write it to make it better. Nmap works on most operating systems. It works on Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and BSD. Most people use it on Linux, but many people use it on Windows.
No man's land	No man's land is land that is not part of any country. It may be unclaimed territory, or an area that is Land claims and not occupied because of fear or uncertainty. During war (especially World War I), it is a term used for the area of land between two enemy trenches. Usually nobody was alive there. It was full of shell holes, dead bodies, and barbed wire, and raked by machine gun fire. Attacks were made across no man's land but few attacking soldiers survived.
Noble gas compound	A noble gas compound is a chemical compound that has an Chemical element from Periodic table group 18 of the periodic table in them. Group 18 (previously called Group 0) contains all the noble gases.
Noli me tangere	According to the evangelist, John 20.17, noli me tangere is a phrase Jesus says to Mary Magdalene, when she recognises him after the Resurrection of Jesus. The phrase is commonly translated as don't touch me. In Koine Greek, the phrase reads Μή μου ἅπτου (mḗ mou háptou), which is translated differently, as cease holding on to me or stop clinging to me. Many artists and painters have been inspired by the phrase.
Non-Euclidean geometry	Non-Euclidean geometry is a type of geometry. Non-Euclidean geometry only uses some of the "postulates" () that Euclidean geometry is based on. In normal geometry, parallel (geometry) lines can never meet. In non-Euclidean geometry they can meet, either infinitely many times (elliptic geometry), or never (hyperbolic geometry). An example of Non-Euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object, straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles
Non-fungible token	A non-fungible token (NFT) is a way of proving that a digital item is the only one of its kind in existence and therefore cannot be copied or reproduced without the owners knowledge and consent.
Non-renewable resource	A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that is used up faster than it can be made by nature. It cannot be produced, grown or generated on a scale which can sustainability how quickly it is being consumed. Once it is used up, there is no more available for the future. Fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), types of nuclear power (uranium) and certain examples. Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) or metals (which can be Recycling) are considered renewable resources. Non-renewable resources are also called exhaustible resources.
Normal (geometry)	In geometry, an object (such as a line) is called normal, if it is at a right angle to another object.
Norton AntiVirus	Norton AntiVirus (NAV) is a popular product of Symantec Corporation. It is one of the most widely used antivirus. Norton AntiVirus is sold as a standalone product. It is also included as part of Norton Internet Security and Norton SystemWorks. There is also a standalone corporate edition version called Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition.
Not proven	Not proven is a type of verdict in Scottish law. Out of the country, the "not proven" verdict may be referred to as the Scottish verdict, and in Scotland itself it may be referred to colloquially as the bastard verdict, which was a term coined by Sir Walter Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk. Scottish law is distinct from English law, and this is one of the differences. Jury may convict with a guilty verdict or they may acquit (see below)). A criminal case jury consists of 15 jurors, and make their decision by a simple majority vote: eight votes are necessary and sufficient for the verdict "guilty", which has replaced the older verdict "proven". In Scotland there are two forms of acquittal:
Notary	A notary is a person who has learned some laws and has been appointed by a Executive (government) to do some certain things using those laws. A notary is most often used to witness signatures on legal papers. A notary does this to help stop fraud and to help a person prove that they are who they say they are. Notaries in some locations can also perform marriage ceremonies.
Notes from the psychoanalysis of Knut Hamsun	During the psychoanalysis of Knut Hamsun, notes were made by his psychoanalyst, Johannes Irgens Strømme; sometimes the notes are referred to as the Strømme/Hamsun manuscript (Norwegian: Strømme/Hamsun-manuset). Hamsun died in 1952 and copies of the notes were published in 2017; the publication is controversial (as of 2017). The existence of the notes led to a race between a group related to [the community of persons who do] research [for a living,] and a group related to publishing.<ref name="Morgenbladet2017psyAnalysis"/> Danish author Thorkild Hansen [[:en:Thorkild Hansen|(en:)]] has said that the notes must certainly be viewed as [an] extremely important source.<ref name="Morgenbladet2017psyAnalysis"/> Media sometimes refers to (as of May 2017,) the notes as "the classified notes".<ref name="Morgenbladet2017psyAnalysis"/>
Novella	A novella is a book shorter than a novel, but longer than a short story. Sometimes it is also called a novellette.
Nuclear chemistry	Nuclear chemistry is the part of chemistry dealing with radioactivity and other parts of atoms.
Nuremberg principles	The Nuremberg principles were a set of [[Wikt:guideline|guideline]]s for what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to Codification (law) the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazism party members following World War II.
Nursery (horticulture)	A nursery is a place where plants are cultivated and grown to usable size. There are retail nurseries which sell to the general public, wholesale nurseries which sell only to other nurseries and to commercial landscape gardeners, and private nurseries which supply the needs of institutions or private estates. Some retail and wholesale nurseries sell by mail.
Nutrient	A nutrient is either a chemical element or chemical compound used in an organism's metabolism or physiology. A nutrient is essential to an organism if it cannot be produced by the organism and must be obtained from a food source. This article deals with nutrition in animals, especially humans. Nutrition in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea is not discussed here.
OEM	OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing. It is mainly used to describe parts for cars, airplanes and electrical systems. It is also used for computer parts and computer programs. The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it. The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price, but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version. For example, an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence, but no instruction manuals.
Obfuscation	Obfuscation means making something harder to understand, usually by complicating sentences needlessly. Weasel words are a form of obfuscation. Obfuscation is usually used when people either do not know what they are talking about or wish to hide their meaning. Some people say that when Medical doctor use difficult medical words to hide unpleasant things from , they are using obfuscation. Technical term: Obfuscation is sometimes used to make source code much harder to read and reverse engineer. This can be a significant concern for technology like Java and JavaScript that require source code to be exposed in order to function.
Objectification	Objectification refers to the treating of an abstract concept as a real thing.
Obstruction of justice	Obstruction of justice is a crime. It can be lying to police about a crime or hiding evidence. Destroying evidence of a crime can also be obstruction of justice.
Octane rating	An octane rating is a measurement of how well fuels resist detonation. Modern engines use high degrees of compression. They therefore need fuel that does not detonate easily. Such fuel has a higher octane rating. The rating is done by comparing the fuel to the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would detonate in the same way. Such a mixture of 90 percent iso-octane and 10 percent heptane has an octane rating of 90. Gas is available with lower octane ratings in the US than in Europe.The octane rating of gasoline tells you how much the fuel can be compressed before it spontaneously ignites. When gas ignites by compression rather than because of the spark from the spark plug, it causes knocking in the engine. Knocking can damage an engine, so it is not something you want to have happening. Lower-octane gas (like "regular" 87-octane gasoline) can handle the least amount of compression before igniting.
Octet rule	The octet rule is a general rule of thumb that applies to most atoms. It states that every atom might want to have eight valence electrons in its outermost electron shell.
Octopus card	The Octopus card is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in Hong Kong. Started in September 1997 to collect fares for the MTR, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has been widely used for all public transport in Hong Kong. It led to the development of Oyster card in London.
Odor	An odor or odour is a volatilized chemical compound, usually at a very low concentration, which humans and other animals perceive by the sense of olfaction. Odors are also called smells, which can be used to describe both pleasant and unpleasant odors. The words fragrance, scent, or aroma are used mostly by the food and cosmetic industry to describe a pleasant odor, and is sometimes used to refer to perfumes. On the other hand, the words stench, reek, and stink are used specifically to describe unpleasant odors.
Offshore investment	Offshore investment is when a person invests money in a different country than the country of residence. This is many done to pay less taxes. Differences in legislation may also be a driving force. Very often money laundering is also done in these countries.
Ohka	The Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka (櫻花 "cherry blossom") was a type of airplane rocket, used for suicide attacks by the Empire of Japan in the last months of World War II. The United States gave the aircraft the name Baka (Japanese language for "stupid"). It was carried by a bomber that dropped it when close enough to an enemy ship. The pilot guided it to crash with the target. When dropping down, it could go so fast that it was almost impossible to stop it. The operational record of Ohkas used in action includes three ships sunk and three other ships with great damage.
Ohm's law	Ohm's law says that in an electrical circuit, the Electric current passing through a resistor is related to the voltage difference and the electrical resistance between the two sides, as long as the physical conditions and the temperature of the conductor remain constant. Because there are three variables, it can be written in three ways, depending on which variable is placed on the left of the equals sign:
One-line diagram	The one-line diagram (or single-line diagram) is a diagram that shows a Three-phase electric power in a simple way. It is used in many power-related applications. Each electrical element is represented by a unique symbol. Although it describes three-phase electricity, only one Electrical conductor is shown in the diagram.
One-time pad	A One-time pad is a method of encryption. It is a symmetrical cipher, which means the same key is needed for encryption and decryption. A one time pad uses a key that is either as long or longer than the message it encrypts. The key must only be used once, and after it is used, a new key must be generated and shared for the cipher to remain secure. If this method is used correctly, it is impossible to decrypt or break the encryption without the key. Failure to make and share random keys has led to successful cryptanalysis, as in the Venona project.Because of these requirements, it is rarely used today.
One-way function	In cryptography, a one-way function is a function (mathematics) that is very simple to compute (figure out) in one direction. There is a series of instructions that can be simply and easily applied to an input to give a complicated output. However the reverse of going from the output to the input is made to be as difficult as possible.
Oneirology	Oneirology (; from Greek language , oneiron, "dream"; and , , "the study of") is the scientific study of dreams. Current research seeks connections between dreaming and current knowledge about how the brain works, as well as understanding of how the brain works during dreaming as pertains to memory formation and mental disorders. The study of oneirology can mean from dream interpretation in that the aim is to quantitatively study the process of dreams instead of analyzing the meaning behind them.Oneirology is about dreams and how they work. Most dreams happen in the REM [rapid eye movement] phase of their sleep. Dreams can have a good chance of coming true. Lucid dreaming is when the dreamer gains some control over their dream.
Online and offline	"Online" and "offline" are terms used in telecommunications. If a computer or a user is connected to the Internet, it is said to be "online". A website, for example, is online, because it is on the Internet. If something is not online, it is said to be "offline". If a system is offline, it is in a disconnected state. Online can also mean that something is set up correctly and ready to what it is supposed to do. For example:
Online shopping	Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or Service (economics) from a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. An online shop, eshop, e-store, Internet shop, webshop, webstore, online store, or virtual store evokes the physical analogy of buying product (business)s or services at a Brick and mortar business Retailing or in a shopping center. The process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When a business buys from another business, it is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. In 1991 the Worldwide Web opened for commercial use. In 1994 other advances took place, such as online banking and the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut. During that same year, Netscape introduced Transport Layer Security encryption of data transferred online, which has become essential for secure online shopping. Also, in 1994, the German company Intershop Communications introduced its first online shopping system. In 1995, Amazon.com launched its online shopping site, and in 1996, eBay appeared.
Open content	Open Content is when someone creates something and lets others it or it without having to ask for . Any Multimedia can be open content, from text and pictures to video and sound. When someone creates something (like a picture or book), they can make that work "open". This means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want. Something that is open content may be of charge, but it does not have to be. The Simple English Wikipedia is open content. So are other Wikipedias. If a person changes open content or makes new open content, everyone can give it to anyone else, or even sell it. It is never needed to ask permission to do this, because the people who wrote the text already gave their permission when they clicked the "save" button.
Open source	Open source is a software similar to free software, but is more related to business. It is different from other software because the source code is available to everyone. The source code is a set of instructions for the computer, written in a programming language. Anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently. The opposite of open source is closed source. Closed source software is not available to everyone. Open source has a lot in common with free software but each has its own focus and goals. Open source and free software have been around for decades. They became more popular with the Linux and BSD software community. To protect the code, a special user license is used. The most common kinds of licence are the GPL, BSD and LGPL. Wikipedia uses open source too. The Open Source Movement is led by the Open Source Initiative. The open source movement became separate from the free software movement in 1998.
OpenNIC	OpenNIC uses an alternative Domain Name System, so users can access more websites than they can on the "normal" internet. Users can still access the "normal" internet. Users can register domain name for free on OpenNIC, whereas doing so on the "normal" internet is usually not free.
OpenVPN	OpenVPN is a VPN protocol that utilizes an Open_source. This means the source code is openly available for anyone to access and develop. An active community has formed around the OpenVPN project, which has kept it up-to-date and provided regular security audits to ensure it’s viability. It is particularly known for its security and privacy as well as its adjustability. OpenVPN typically works on any port and has five encryption algorithms to such as Secure_Sockets_Layer, IPsec or SSHFor the best security and privacy, you should use AES 256-bit encryption, which is essentially unbreakable and should also use a Network_port. The TCP 443 port will make your connection similar to an https connection. It is essentially a secure connection which can help prevent website blocking and can help you bypass censorship. For greater speed, it is recommended to use UDP ports, and you can select the default, Blowfish (cipher). This isn’t the absolute highest level of security, but for most people, it will suffice and will operate significantly faster than AES 256 on TCP.
Operant conditioning	Operant conditioning is a form of learning. In it, an individual changes its behaviour because of the (results) of the behaviour. The person or animal learns its behaviour has a . That consequence may be
Operating reserve	In electrical grid, operating reserve is the ability of the power generation to respond for any power loss or power failure at the load side in a relatively short time to avoid long power shortage. Operating reserve is made of spinning reserve and non-spinning reserve.
Operation Yellow Ribbon	Operation Yellow Ribbon was started by Canada to help with the diversion of civilian airline flights because of the September 11 attacks in 2001. It was to make sure that possible destructive air traffic was removed from the United States airspace as quickly as possible, and away from potential U.S. targets. Instead they placed the aircraft on the ground in Canada, mainly at military and civilian airports in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia (as well as some in New Brunswick, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec). Canada began the operation after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (carried out by Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA)) had grounded all the aircraft across the United States. The FAA was then able to work with Transport Canada to reroute the incoming international flights to airports in Canada. The actual number of diverted aircraft and passengers varies from different sources. Transport Canada stated that over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights arrived in Canada, while NAV CANADA stated that there were 239 flights. Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien said that the number of flights was anywhere between 225 and 250 and that the number of passengers were between 30,000 and 45,000.
Optical illusion	An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is one which shows visual perception that illusion. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception. That is normal, but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus (psychology) source. There are three main types of visual illusion:
Options Clearing Corporation	Options Clearing Corporation (also called "OCC") is a United States Clearing house (finance) based in Chicago. Clearing houses are used to help traders, and they make sure each trade is correctly made, or "cleared". The OCC does this "clearing" with stocks, stock options, and many things that are very much like options (called equity derivatives). "Clearing" for stocks is very much like clearing a bank check. The OCC provides this service to at least 14 exchanges, where stocks, options, and contracts to buy or sell copper, gold, grain, oil, and other needed supplies. They also provide services for people and companies that need to borrow stocks. When someone borrows a stock, they have to pay OCC some money every day. This is the same as people who pay a bank for a loan of money. Like all clearing houses, the OCC makes sure that nobody cheats, and they check everything to be sure that it is working. The OCC has about $100 billion US dollars of money deposited by big banks and trading companies (or "members"). Each day, the big banks and trading companies use the OCC to trade billions of dollars worth of stocks and other equity derivatives. In 2015, they had 4.2 billion trades. That was the third highest in their history. In 2011, OCC was the largest clearing house in the USA. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are the two parts of government that watch over OCC. Under the SEC, OCC helps with stocks and options, indexes for stocks, foreign currencies, and futures contracts. The OCC is called a "registered Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO)" by the CFTC. The have helped pay for schools to teach investors about trading, and they help finance advisors and companies learn answers to very difficult problems. They also teach about risk. OCC is run by a board of directors, and the board is mostly people who work at big banks and trading companies. They are a utility, like a power company is a utility, but for financial things. They are called a financial utility provider. They make money from the big banks and trading companies they work with. Members include:
Orbital revolution	Orbital revolution is the movement of a planet around a star, or a moon around a planet. For example, the Earth revolves around the Sun, and the Moon revolves about the Earth. Planets and moons revolve in ellipse orbits. One orbital revolution of a planet takes one year, while a revolution of the Moon takes a month. Astronomers usually use different words for the orbit of a planet around a star, and for the spin of a planet about its own axis. If an item is in orbit, it is "revolving", while the spin of a planet is called "rotating". The amount of time it takes for an object to revolve around the Sun is a year, and the amount of time it takes to revolve around its axis is one day. According to the Gregorian calendar, a year on Earth is equal to 365 days, with an extra day added every four years. The amount of time it takes for an object to move around the sun is different for every object. For example, it takes the planet Mercury (planet) about 88 daya to revolve around the sun, but it takes the dwarf planet Pluto over 248 years to revolve around the sun.
Orchard	An orchard is where trees or shrubs that produce food are grown. Fruit, nuts, and vegetables are grown in orchards. They are grown to be sold. Orchards are sometimes a part of large gardens. They are put there to look nice and to produce food.
Organic chemistry	Organic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds that contain carbon. Carbon has the ability to form a chemical bond with a wide variety of chemical elements and other carbon atoms. This allows a nearly unlimited number of combinations, called organic compounds. The subject of carbon compounds is called organic chemistry because all known organisms, or living things, are made up of water and carbon compounds. Organic chemistry largely involves the synthesis, or formation, of organic products by chemical reaction using different reactants and reagents, the substances used up during a reaction. Several different areas of chemistry expand on the concepts and principles of organic chemistry, including biochemistry, microbiology, and medicine.
Organic farms	Organic farms grow foods without using man-made chemicals (like pesticides or herbicides) which can harm the environment or wildlife.
Organotroph	An organotroph is an organism that lives off organic compounds. It is a word used in microbiology to describe organisms based on how they get electrons for respiration (breathing). Some organotrophs are also heterotrophs. Organotrophs may or may not need oxygen in order to grow.
Orientability	In the Euclidean space, R3 is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is Chirality (chemistry). This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable.
Origin story	In entertainment, an origin story is a story that tells how a character or group of characters became the way they are. Very often, it adds to the main story. In Comic book, an origin story explains how certain characters obtained the powers they have (often superpowers), or how they became a hero or villain. When the comic or book is successful and grows older, origin stories are often rewritten and extended.
Orthographic depth	Orthographic depth how much one-to-one relationship there is between the sounds of a language and the Letter used to write them, or how much a word is spelled the way it sounds. Writing systems with a close one-to-one relationship between sounds and letters are called orthographically shallow writing systems. This includes the Spanish alphabet, Japanese language kana, the Finnish alphabet, the Turkish alphabet, and the Italian alphabet. In these languages, it is easy to figure out how to speak these languages simply by reading them. Writing systems with little one-to-one relationship between sounds and letters are called orthographically deep writing systems. These would include the English alphabet, French alphabet, Mongolian script, and Thai script.
Orthographic projection	Orthographic projection is a way of showing a 3D object in 2D. It is a form of parallel projection, where the view direction is orthogonal to the projection plane.
Orthography	Orthography is an official or correct way to Writing a particular language. It includes rules of spelling. Orthography may also include rules about punctuation, capitalization, and diacritics (e.g. accents). In English, spelling is a problem for all learners, and is the main issue in orthography. Some languages have someone to decide the correct spelling, such as the Académie française. English does not. English orthography was the work of the early printings. They had to decide how particular words would be spelled in their books. Gradually the number of alternative spellings began to drop. The word which is "merry" today was spelled in about 30 ways in written sources from the 9th to the 16th century.<ref name=Tom/>p970
Otherkin	Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside themselves, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal can be e.g. a wolf, a dragon or an extraterrestrial life. Some otherkin say that they are vampires and are usually acting like them, e.g. by drinking blood. Otherkin may also identify as feeling a special connection to other natural elements, i.e. minerals, the likes of fire, water, and wind, plants, etc.. Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they are otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a reincarnation, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physics body are not human, either, but there is no either for or against that.
Outsider art	Outsider art is art that is non-commercial and that lives outside the usual art gallery. Usually it is created by people who have little or no artistic training in art schools. Some may have a mental illness like schizophrenia.<ref name="moran"/> People who do outsider art are called outsider artists. They create their art from their own inner experience, not caring or knowing what other artists maybe doing. The term outsider art was first used by art critic Roger Casement in 1972.<ref name="moran"/> These artists often create buildings with strange architecture they build alone. Some of them also do more conventional arts like painting, sculpture. Outsider art includes the works of:
Over-harvesting	Over-harvesting means taking more from the land (or sea) than it can replace. It includes extreme farming, grazing, fishing, and using fresh water. Over-harvesting is harmful in the long term. Forests or wetlands are hard to replace. Damage to nature hurts animals and humans. Most wetlands are damaged by overuse as a source of drinking water, and are sometimes drained to make farmland or land for building. A thriving and diverse ecosystem is destroyed. Over-harvesting also applies to animals. Population numbers may drop as a result, and species may become extinct. Overfishing is a typical example. Nowadays, you can only fish, shoot deer or birds at certain times of the year. The season when they mate, reproduce and lay eggs or have the young are protected. Areas of especial natural beauty or scientific interest are also protected. Taking bird eggs is also now against the law, at least in the United Kingdom. One thing which acts against conservation is the overpopulation of the world. The greatest single reason why the world loses forests is that some people want the land for other purposes. A few people gain, but everyone shares the cost. This is called the tragedy of the commons.
Overcoat	An overcoat is a long coat which is worn over other clothes. Overcoats are made from a warm, heavy cloth or even animal fur. They go below the knee in length. A coat that is knee length is known as a topcoat. Overcoats have been worn for hundreds of years. Many armies dressed their soldiers in overcoats during the winter. There are many styles and types of overcoats. These include:
Overfishing	Overfishing is catching too much fish. It is a type of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to low levels. It is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term. Also, what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them (tragedy of the commons). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing. So much fish is caught that there are too few adults of certain species left. With cod, for example, the greatest production of eggs is from large females. But these are caught, the average size of spawning females goes down. Eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced. The artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females. The Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s. Sometimes, the fishing industry can ruin itself by overfishing. The collapse of the herring industry in Monterey, California is a good example. Consumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them.
Overpopulation	Overpopulation means that the population of a place is too high. Specifically, there are too many organisms of a certain species in a habitat, so the number of organisms living there is larger than the carrying capacity of the habitat. The habitat cannot support these numbers over time without hurting itself. The term "overpopulation" is most often used to refer to the number of too many humans living on Earth.
Overvoltage	An overvoltage is whenever power circuits are raised beyond their desired levels. The conditions of an overvoltage are sometimes hazardous. Incidents that may lead to an overvoltage may include a solar flare or lightning.
Ox Mountain	Ox Mountain () is a story by the Chinese philosopher Mencius. In his time this mountain was in very bad shape, and everybody knew how it looked. Here is the story:
PC bang	PC bang is a type of gaming center in South Korea where people can play multiplayer computer games. It is like a LAN gaming center. became very popular when Starcraft came out in 1998. PC-bang users are usually young South Koreans. Most PC-bang users are students in grade school or college, mostly male.<ref name="kt"/> Inside PC bangs, people may smoke, eat, and drink. Most PC bangs sell Ramen, canned coffee, energy drinks, and other snacks.
PH	pH is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is.More acidic solutions have lower pH. More alkaline solutions have higher pH. Substances that aren't acidic or alkaline (that is, neutral solutions) usually have a pH of 7.Acids have a pH that is less than 7. Alkalis have a pH that is greater than 7. pH is a measure of the [[:en:Concentration|concentration]] of protons (H+) in a solution. [[:en:S. P. L. Sørensen|S.P.L. Sørensen]] introduced this concept in the year 1909. The p stands for the German language potenz, meaning power or concentration, and the H for the hydrogen ion (H+). The most common formula for calculating pH is:
POST (HTTP)	In Internet computing, POST is one of many HTTP#Request methods supported by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (or HTTP). POST acts to submit data to be processed to a specific Resource (Web). As examples this may be a Message (computer science) for a Internet forum, a Usenet, or a mailing list. It can also be an item of data for a database. In contrast, the HTTP GET (HTTP) request method is designed to retrieve (or get) information from a server.
PSU Zephyrus	The PSU Zephyrus is a human powered aircraft being built by students at the Pennsylvania State University. This aircraft will be powered entirely by the one pilot on board. Mark D. Maughmer currently gives advice to the team.
Pacific Northwest tree octopus	The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus is a fake animal created in 1998 by Lyle Zapato. Zapato's website says the tree octopus is real, and that it lives on both land and water. Zapato created this website about the fake tree octopus to show how important it is to think carefully about whether things on the Internet are true or not. The original website that described the fake species is commonly used as an example in internet literacy classes to teach students to check more carefully if sources of information are reliable. The text included other hoax species and organizations, mixed with links to pages about real species and organizations. Despite the falsehoods shown on the site, all 25 seventh-grade students involved in one well-publicized test believed the content. All but one of the 25 rated the site as "very credible".
Package management system	A package management system keeps track of information about software packages: what files go where, and which package owns that file, therefore behaving like a phone directory. Examples of package management systems for Linux include dpkg, rpm and Portage. In Microsoft Windows, "Add/Remove Programs"/"Programs and Features" are like package managers, but use no format (it leaves it up to the program).
Padded cell	A padded cell is a special in a hospital for mentally ill people. It's made so that the s can be put there when they go through a (or they have a fit or seizure). They are put there so they can go through their crisis on their own, without putting others into danger. Padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis cannot hurt themselves. Padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry. In the 1980s, their use declined in Europe. This is because there are drugs that can be given that make them nearly unnecessary. They are still widely used, especially in Africa and Asia. Seizures and crises are usually very tiring. For this reason, patients usually only spend a short time in these cells. They usually collapse because of fatigue rather quickly. When they do, they need medical attention quickly.
Padding (cryptography)	Padding is a term used in cryptography. Very often, messages (to be encrypted) start or end in a well-known way (Dear Bob, ..., Yours, Alice). This is a problem, because that knowledge could be used to break (or start to break) encryption. To prevent this, a number of random characters are added at the beginning or the end of the message. This procedure may also be necessary because many cryptographic methods operate on blocks of code. If a block is not full, additional characters need to be filled in. Filling in random text has proven very useful.
Paddy field	When growing Aquatic plant, such as rice and taro, paddy fields are used. These fields are filled with shallow water at least part of the year. Growing these plants is very labor-intensive. A lot of water is needed. Paddy-fields started next to the Yangtze River in China, in the Neolithic. Later, their use spread to other areas in Asia. Paddy fields are built next to marshes or using terraces, on a hillside. Deepwater rice is not grown using paddy fields: It needs water over deep for at least a month.
Page-turner	A page-turner is a person whose job is to turn sheet music pages for a solo musician, often a pianist, usually during a performance. While some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them, this is not always possible. A page-turner is often needed by musicians who are playing difficult pieces and prefer not to play from memory. A page-turner needs to be able to understand the musician's signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page. Page-turners are sometimes friends of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra helping the musician. Professional page-turners are usually freelance casual workers. Mechanical page-turners are also available, sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal. Charles Halle is said to have invented the automatic page-turner.
PageCloud	PageCloud is a software as a service, cloud-based web development platform and which enable drag and drop website builder.
Pairwise comparison	Pairwise comparison is any process of comparing things in pairs to judge which of two things is preferred, or has a greater amount of some something, or whether or not the two things are identical. The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, Voting system, Social choice theory, public choice, requirements engineering and multiagent AI systems. In psychology literature, it is often referred to as paired comparison.
Pajamas	Pajamas (pyjamas in the United Kingdom) are loose clothes that people wear while they are sleeping. Pyjamas usually include trousers and a shirt. Pyjamas are often made of cotton. They are usually worn without underwear. The word comes from , Pajāmā; . Pajamas are often worn without underwear.
Pakistani nationality law	The Pakistani nationality law are the laws on citizenship of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The main law on nationality, the Pakistan Citizenship Act, was passed by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 13 April 1951. Pakistan is the only country in Asia with unconditional jus soli citizenship rights.
Pakistani passport	Pakistani passports () are Passport issued by the Government of Pakistan to Pakistani nationality law for the purpose of international travel. They are issued by the Directorate General of Immigration & Passports (DGIP) of the Ministry of Interior (Pakistan) from regional passport offices and the Pakistani Embassies and Consulates. Since January 2014, Pakistani passports have validity for 5 and 10 years. Under national law, Pakistani passports are explicitly invalid for all travel to the Israel, and Pakistani nationals are likewise strictly barred from travelling to the Jewish state under all circumstances. Pakistan is the only country in the world that does not Diplomatic recognition Armenia as a nation. In 2019 after an interview with WION (TV channel), Prime minister Nikol Pashinyan has stated that Armenia supports India in the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. Therefore travelling to Hayastan is not permitted there either.
Palau Language Commission	The Palau Language Commission, is the official regulation body of the Palauan language. It was created after the adoption of a bill by the Palau National Congress, aims to "preserve and maintain the standardized use of the Palauan language" by establishing grammatical and spelling rules.
Palau de les Belles Arts	The Palau de les Belles Arts was a multipurpose building in Barcelona . Demolished in 1942, it was built on the occasion of the universal exhibition of 1888, in the space where the municipal courts are currently in front of the Parc de la Ciutadella, on the corner of Passeig de Lluís Companys and Passeig de Pujades .
Palm oil	Palm oil is a vegetable oil. Natural palm oil is red, but the red part is usually removed before the oil is used. It is made from the fruit of the African Oil Palm tree. Some comes from the American Oil Palm. Palm oil is used in many different products, like ice cream, toothpaste, chocolate, and candy. Most palm oil is made in West Africa and Southeast Asia on Plantation.
Pangram	Pangrams are sentences that have one or more of every letter in an alphabet. They are used to show every letter in a font, or to test a Keyboard (computer) or typewriter. The most common example in English language is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Panthoibi Jagoi	"Panthoibi Jagoi" () (literally, "Panthoibi's dance" or "Dance dedicated to the Divine Mother") is a duet dance form, portraying the romantic love affairs between Nongpok Ningthou and Panthoibi. It takes place in 14 sequence of hand gestures with bodily movements. It is performed in the religious festival of Lai Haraoba, depicting the weaving process. In the dance form, Marjing has been conflated with Nongpok Ningthou. Nowadays, the dance form is replaced by the Khamba Thoibi Jagoi.
Panthoibi Khongul	Panthoibi Khongul ()(literally, "in quest of Panthoibi" or "Panthoibi's footprint"), also spelt as Panthoipi Khongkul, is an ancient Meitei literary work (Puya (Meitei texts)), narrating about the quest of goddess Panthoibi. The text highlights the love saga of Panthoibi and her ultimate lover Nongpok Ningthou, after leaving her husband's house. Many scholars believe the work to be written during the 12th century AD. The text also talks about how the festival Lai Haraoba was begun after the union of the two lovers.
Paparazzi Project	Paparazzi is a DIY and open-source micro Unmanned aerial vehicle. Created in 2003, paparazzi is developed in the laboratories of the École nationale de l'aviation civile (French civil aviation university). Paparazzi system allows to fly one or more micro-UAVs independently, with a Global Positioning System or controlled by a Linux ground station. Paparazzi has acquired a world-renowned in the field of micro-UAVs, for its technical qualities and its the cost, relatively low concerning the components needed to manufacture the system.
Parable	A parable is a short story in prose or verse. It teaches something. On the surface, it may be about animals or objects, but is just a metaphor for the real idea. Familiar are the parables of Jesus, where he explains an idea by telling a story. Familiar also are the parables of Aesop.
Paraffin	In chemistry, paraffin is the common name for the alkane hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2. Paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40, inclusive. The simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane, CH4, a gas at room temperature. Heavier members of the series, such as that of octane, C8H18, and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature. The solid forms of paraffin, called paraffin wax, are from the heaviest molecules from C20H42 to C40H82. Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830. Paraffin, or paraffin hydrocarbon, is also the technical name for an alkane in general, but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear, or normal alkane — whereas branched, or isoalkanes are also called isoparaffins. It is distinct from the fuel known in Ireland, Britain and South Africa as Kerosene or just paraffin, which is called kerosene in most of the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. The name is derived from the Latin parum (= barely) + affinis with the meaning here of "lacking electron affinity", or "lacking Reactivity (chemistry)". This is because alkanes, being non-polar and lacking in functional groups, are very unreactive.
Parallel (geometry)	Parallel is a term in geometry and in everyday life that refers to a property of lines or Plane (mathematics). Parallel lines or planes are next to each other, but never touch each other. This means they never at any point (geometry). If two lines \ell_1 and \ell_2 are parallel, then we describe this by writing \ell_1 \parallel \ell_2. The slopes of parallel lines are always equal. Even if these two line segments were extended to infinity, there would never be a point of intersection between the two of them. In fact, two parallel lines in the two-dimensional plane are always a fixed distance apart.
Parallel postulate	In geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Sometimes it is also called Euclid's fifth postulate, because it is the fifth postulate in Euclid's Euclid's Elements. The postulate says that: If you cut a line segment with two lines, and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than 180°, then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough. The field of geometry which follows all of Euclid's axioms is called Euclidean geometry. Geometries which do not follow all of Euclid's axioms are called non-Euclidean geometry.
Parasomnia	Parasomias are sleep disorders that interrupt sleep. They can be broadly classified:
Pareidolia	Pareidolia ) is a word from Ancient Greek language to describe the phenomenon, that the human mind often perceives familiar patterns in a stimulus, even when they are not there. Common examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the "man in the moon", the "moon rabbit", and hidden messages within recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds. Pareidolia is a special case of clustering illusion.
Parental advisory	ParmParental Advisory is a sticker that tells parents that something may not be suitable for children. The sticker is usually placed on Music CDs. It tells parents that the texts of the songs contain words or phrases that some consider bad for children. Parental Advisory stickers will usually appear on Hip Hop and Rap albums. Comic books may also have a Parental Advisory sticker on them.
Parliamentary procedure	Parliamentary procedure is a commonly accepted way in which a group of people work together to discuss and make decisions. It is a set of rules for meetings.
Partial discharge	A partial discharge (PD) is an electric discharge that breaks through a small portion of the Insulator (electricity) between two Electrical conductor. A discharge is when electrical charge that has accumulated is suddenly released (like a ). A partial discharge does not completely cross the insulation between the two conductors, only a small portion of it in one area. It may happen under the Stress (mechanics) of high voltage. It is caused by a small opening (void) inside the insulating material. The insulating material can be either solid or fluid. The charge passing through this insulation is called electrical breakdown.
Particle	A particle is a tiny bit of matter that makes up everything in the universe. In particle physics, an elementary particle is a particle which cannot be split up into smaller pieces. There are many different types of particles, with different particle size (general)s and properties. Macroscopic particles are particles that are larger than atoms or molecules. They have volume and shape. Powder and dust are some examples of macroscopic particles. Nanoparticles are an intermediate size, being a very fine powder but much larger than atoms. Atoms and molecules are called microscopic particles. Subatomic particles are particles that are smaller than atoms. The proton, the neutron, and the electron are subatomic particles. These are the particles which make atoms. The proton has a charge (a + charge). The neutron has a Electric charge. The electron has a Electric charge (a - charge), and it is the smallest of these three particles. In atoms, there is a small Nucleus (physics) in the center, which is where the protons and neutrons are, and electrons orbit the nucleus. Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. Quarks are subatomic particles, but they are also elementary particles because we do not know if they are made up of even smaller particles. There are six different types of quarks. These are the up quark, the down quark, the strange quark, the charm quark, the bottom quark, and the top quark. A neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. The proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark. ?
Particle size (general)	The term particle size is used to compare dimensions of different small material objects. Larger objects are usually called stone, Rock (geology), a piece of something, etc. The term particle indicates small size, usually less than centimeter. Particle might be either solid, or liquid, or even gas. Liquid particles are called droplets. Gaseous particles are bubbles. All of them can be characterised in terms of size.
Partition editor	Partition editor, partitioner, and partitioning utility are all names for computer programs used to view, create, change, and delete Partition (computing) on a computer Data storage device, most commonly a hard disk, but also a USB flash drive or other storage medium. A partition is a section or segment of the storage space on a storage device. By partitioning a large device into several partitions it is possible to isolate various types of data from one another, and allow the coexistence of two or more operating systems simultaneously. Partition editors can come in many different forms. Command-line interface such as diskpart in Windows and fdisk or parted in Linux offer accurate control of partition editing. Graphical user interfaces and consoles like Disk Management in Windows and GParted or KDE Partition Manager allow for use by less skilled users.
Partition table	A partition table maps out Disk partition onto a Data storage device. The two biggest examples are MBR and GPT. Others include Apple Partition Map (APM), which is used in Apple Inc. computers, and Berkeley Software Distribution disklabel. MBR, or Master Boot Record, is a section at the very beginning of a storage device that uses MBR. It contains a partition table, along with storage for a bootloader so the computer can boot. It can only hold up to 2 Tebibyte of data, and can only have up two four partitions. GPT, or GUID Partition table, is a partition table that was developed as part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. It can have up to 128 partitions. Depending on the size of the disk sectors, it can hold a large amount of data. If your sectors are 512 bytes, like MBR, it can hold 8 Zebibyte of data.
Partnership of a European Group of Aeronautics and Space Universities	Partnership of a European Group of Aeronautics and Space UniversitieS (PEGASUS) is the biggest network for Aeronautics and Aerospace engineering universities in Europe. It has been created in 1998 by the France National Aeronautics universities (École nationale de l'aviation civile, École nationale supérieure de mécanique et d'aérotechnique and Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace). The European manufacturers like Airbus have close contact with PEGASUS network.
Party (law)	A party is a person or group of persons that make up a single [[Wikt:entity|entity]] for the purposes of the law. They are a participant in legal proceeding and have an interest in the outcome. Parties include: the plaintiff, the defendant, a petitioner or a respondent. A person who only appears in the case as a witness is not considered a party. Courts use various terms to identify the role of a particular party in Civil law litigation. They usually call the party that brings a lawsuit as the plaintiff, or, in older United States legal case, the party of the first part. The party against whom the case was brought as the defendant, or, in older American cases, the party of the second part.
Passion cantata	A Passion cantata is a cantata. The cantata takes its theme from the Passion of Jesus Christ, in other words his suffering until his death at the cross. Larger cantatas with this theme are known as oratorios. Today, most of them are performed in the week before Easter.
Passive-aggressive behaviour	Passive-aggressive behaviour is aggression that pretends to be innocent. This means someone pretends to be nice, but is actually being mean. It can happen when people do what others want to stop direct , but they do not agree with what is ordered or suggested. A passive-aggressive person tries to hide their anger. For example, "I would have had a good day if I hadn't been cleaning up someone's mess". This sounds okay when someone first reads it, but it is actually them being mad at the person who made the mess. This is not a Mental illness. It is just a way of Behavior. In the workplace it occurs when people do not want to do what the employer wants them to do. The behaviour was first Definition during World War II. Men were not openly . They used "passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" to show their Emotion.
Password	A password is a way of authentication. It can be used as a means to identify a person. Since the password is the only way to identify a person, it has to be kept secret. A password can be static. This means it will remain the same unless the user changes it, or it rarely changes. Or a password can be dynamic. A dynamic password changes regularly and does not remain the same. One type of a dynamic password is a one-time pad that can only be used once. Passwords were first used in the military. This was to be able to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy when it was dark. Modern passwords are made of character (computing), letters and numbers. Sometimes a password will require a minimum number of characters. Usually this is from six to eight. Some websites allow only the use of letters and numbers, but no other characters on the keyboard (computer). Other websites advise using a combination of letters and numbers to increase the "strength" of a password. Websites also advise changing a password once a year or more often to prevent hacking. A person may be able to guess a password if it is too easy. While being typed, each letter of a password is shown as * or •. Other ways of verifying the identity of a person include using fingerprint scanners and face detection. Encryption is the translation of data to achieve data security. To read an encrypted string a secret key or password must be provided to decrypt it. In systems that uses login based actions, the password can be converted to the original string if the key is provided. Hashing is a one-way function and is irreversible.
Pastel	A pastel is an art colour in the form of a stick. It is made of pure powdered pigment and a 'binder' which holds it together. Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all kinds of coloured art. The effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. Chalk may be added to the pastel to tone down the more vivd colours. An artwork made using pastels is called a pastel, pastel drawing or pastel painting. As an adjective the word 'pastel' means pale in colour.
Pasties	Pasties (sing. 'pastie') are small pieces of cloth, plastic or metal. They are treated specially so they are sticky. They are used to cover a girl's nipples or genital area. They vary in size and are usually not much larger than the person's areola. The concept of 'pasties' is to show as much of the breast as possible without making the woman entirely topless. Many exotic dancers in strip clubs are required to wear them by law. Pasties are usually applied with a special glue or tape. This is the origin of their name, as they are quite literally 'pasted' onto the nipple. Pasties are worn by many neo-burlesque performers. Burlesque pasties may also feature tassels which hang from the center, performer will sometimes twirl these as part of a performance. Some women who choose not to wear a brassière wear pasties to prevent their nipples from protruding visibly through their shirt.
Pasture	A pasture is a piece of land. Usually specific grasses and herbs are grown on it. Then livestock is put on for Grazer. Rangeland is similarly used, but less controlled.
Patch	A patch is a piece of a flexible material used to repair an object that has a hole in it, to protect an object from damage even before it is damaged, or to decorate clothing or other fabric items.
Patina	A patina is a of various chemical compounds such as oxides or carbonates formed on the surface of metal or other material. Often this is due to exposure to weather. The word "patina" comes from the Latin language word meaning "shallow dish". For many works of art the patina adds to its value. In many cases, the artist wanted the work to acquire a patina over time.<ref name=Gilmore88/>
Patronage	Generally, patronage is the support, encouragement, and often finance aid given by a person or an organization. It can also refer to the business given by a regular customer, and the patron saint. In some countries the term is often used to describe the corrupt use of state money and goods to benefit groups, families, Ethnic group or race (sociology)s in exchange for votes. These patronage systems are different depending on the area in which they are practiced. The term comes from the Latin patronatus.
Pattern language	Pattern language is used to mean a system of patterns that have a certain meaning other than just the pattern.
Pavillon de l'Arsenal	The Pavillon de l'Arsenal is a museum in Paris, France. The museum is dedicated to architecture and urban planning in Paris and the Parisian metropolis. A museum of fine arts was opened first opened in 1879 on the site of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal. In 1988, it became the first centre for urban planning and architecture in Paris.
PayPal	PayPal is a website that allows the Payment among people via web services and email. The money can be deposited into a bank account. PayPal was owned by eBay, from 2002 to 2015. It can be used in more than 200 countries.
Payment	A payment is the transfer of something from one Party (law) to another. Giving money to a company is a payment, for example. A payment is usually made for good (economics) or Service (economics)s. The oldest form of payment is barter. Barter is a simple form of payment. It is the transfer of one good or service for another. Today, payment is usually with money, cheque, Debit card, Credit card, bank transfer, or mobile payment. In transfers between businesses, sometimes payments can be complicated, with stock and other things. In law, the payer is the party that sends the payment and the payee is the party that gets the payment.
Peabody Award	The George Foster Peabody Awards (Peabody Awards) are international awards for excellence in radio and television. It is named after philanthropist and banker George Foster Peabody.
Peaking power plant	A peaking power plant (or peaker) is a power station that only runs during peak hours of demand of electricity. Because of that, the price of electricity it generates is generally higher than the electricity generated by base load power plant, which operates continuously throughout the year. Peak hours may include hot afternoons when air conditioners are working. Examples of peaking power plants are a hydropower plant, pumped-storage hydro power plant, and gas-fired power plant. Nuclear and solar power are not used in this way.
Peer pressure	Peer pressure is being influenced by the peer group members. It often happens to children during puberty. The group defines some social values. For somebody to stay "cool" in that group, they feel as if they have to act like other people in that group. Social pressure (and wanting to be accepted or in favour inside the group) leads people to do things they would not do otherwise. For example, it can influence a person to smoke cigarettes or marijuana, to drink alcohol, commit crimes, and/or many other things that they might regret. Through adolescents are seen adults from external physical point of view, they lack proper mental maturity. Similarly, they look physically matured and do not intend to be in children's group but adults also do not value them as adults. Therefore, they create peer group of their own age to enjoy themselves. They have strong faith and belief on the friends of the same groups. Because of the changes they experience, the new desires, aspirations and interests are developed. They become sensitive and sentimental. When parents and society do not consider and address their needs, aspirations and desires, they feel dominated and leave home to pass most of their time with their friends on peer groups. Sometimes they cannot get proper counselling and guidelines in these stages. Consequently, sometimes, they can fall prey to many bad habits. there are many positives and negatives by peer pressure. Positive peer pressure, in which people are influenced to do nice things like give to charity, is usually a good thing.
Peer-to-peer file sharing	Peer-to-peer file sharing is the sharing and distribution of digital media using peer-to-peer networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access files, like movies, books, music and games using a P2P software program. There is an ongoing discussion related to the economy impact of P2P file sharing. The economic effect of copyright infringement under peer-to-peer file sharing on music has been controversy and hard to determine. Some unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on overall record sales. The United States' Motion Picture Association of America said that American studios lost just over $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005. That was about one third of the total cost of movie piracy in the United States. The estimate from the MPAA was doubted by commentators. It was based under the assumption that one download was the equivalent of one lost sale. Downloaders might not buy the movie if downloading was an option.
Pelagic zone	The pelagic zone is the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast. The name comes from the Greek language πέλαγος (pélagos), which might be translated as "open sea". To make this clear, seas around continents have continental crust beneath them. They are shallow. Seas away from continents can be very deep, and do not have continental shelf beneath them.
Penjing	Penjing (盆景 pinyin: pén jǐng, literally tray scenery) is the ancient China art of growing trees and plants in containers. The plants are kept small by skilled prune. Penjing is similar to the Japanese art of bonsai.
Pennsylvania Bar Association	The Pennsylvania Bar Association is an United States voluntary association of lawyers and people going to school for law. It is located in the state of Pennsylvania and is for people who work in that state. In the year 2013, 28,000 people were a part of the association.
Penthouse	A Penthouse is typically an apartment on the highest floor of an apartment building. It usually takes up less than half of the entire (flat) roof of the building. Originally the word penthouse meant a small building with a sloped roof. The modern use of the word started in the 1920s in United States. In the age of skyscrapers the "house" on the roof was called a penthouse.<ref name=Hayes170.1/> A penthouse can also be Commerce.
People's Bank (Sri Lanka)	People's Bank is a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka. Established on 1 July 1961, it has its head-offices at Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner Street in Colombo. The bank offer both retail and corporate banking services, with a network of 739 local branches, service centers and has an asset base of LKR 1.873 trillion (2019) with over 14 million customers. People's Bank received a high national long-Term Rating of AA+ by Fitch Rating.<ref name="pbFY19" />
Per curiam decision	In law, a per curiam decision (or opinion) is a ruling issued by an appellate court in which the decision rendered is made by the court (or at least, a majority of the court) acting collectively and unanimously. In contrast to regular opinions, a per curiam does not list the individual judge responsible for authoring the decision,<ref name="blacks"/> but minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed. Per curiams are not the only type of decision that can reflect the opinion of the court. Other types of decisions can also reflect the opinion of the entire court, such as decisions, in which the opinion of the court is expressed with an author listed.
Percent-encoding	Percent-encoding, also known as URL-encoding, is the process of preparing Character (computing) to be used as parts of URLs on the Internet.
Perfectionism	Perfectionism, in psychology, is a type of personality where there is a need for oneself or others to be the best in any given part of life. There are only two outcomes; anything less than perfect is taken to be unacceptable. The belief holds that one can achieve perfection and should aim for it. A person who believes this is called a perfectionist. At first, some consider perfectionism as helpful. Perfectionism can lead people to achieve great things and give them motivation. However, it is considered to be a belief that is mostly unhealthy and harmful. Perfectionism makes people set goals that are unrealistic and cannot be reached. Perfectionism may also lead to procrastination as it allows one to avoid being less than perfect ("I can't do this project until I can do it the right way."). This can mean low productivity. Perfectionistic behaviour is growing in the newer generation. Perfectionism has received more attention by popular sayings like “practice makes perfect”. There are also more and more people who see themselves as a perfectionist. These people also mentioned their difficulties which comes with this behaviour.<ref name=":1" />
Perimeter	In geometry, perimeter is the distance around a flat object. For example, all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8). For a polygon, the perimeter is simply the sum of the length of all of its sides. For a rectangle, the perimeter is twice the sum of its length and width (P=2 \ell + 2w). Perimeter can also be calculated for other planar figures, such as circle, sector and ellipse. Real-life objects have perimeters as well. A football field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. This means that the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet. The perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference.<ref name=":0" /> It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times "Pi". Pi is a constant which is approximately equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depends on the accuracy required for the result.
Period (periodic table)	A period in the periodic table is any horizontal row of Chemical elements. Each elements in the same period has one more proton than the one to its left. This means its atomic number is one number higher. The elements in the same period are very metallic on the left and nonmetallic on the right. The smaller atoms are on the left and the larger ones are on the right because the atoms have more protons and electrons. The first period has 2 elements, hydrogen and helium. The second period and third period each have 8 elements. The fourth period and fifth period each have 18 elements. The sixth period and seventh period each have 32 elements. F-block elements are counted in the sixth and seventh periods. Hence, each one has 32 elements in it.
Permit	A permit is a written document that has been given by a government source. Permits let a person do something that he could not do without the permit. Permits are commonly gotten for these reasons:
Permutation box	In cryptography, a permutation box (or P-box) is a [[wiktionary:Method|method]] of bit-shuffling used to permute or transpose bits (rearrange or swap the order of bits) across Substitution box inputs, maintaining Confusion and diffusion while Transpose.<ref name="Cryptography 2007"></ref> In block ciphers, the S-boxes and P-Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext difficult to understand (see Shannon's Confusion and diffusion).
Persian architecture	Persian architecture or Iranian architecture is the name of the Architecture style of Iran from the Pre-Islamic period until the Islamic period of today. this type of architecture style including also the Persian Garden style.
Perspective (graphical)	In graphic arts, perspective is the representation of how an image is seen by the eye. It is about how the angle and distance of a 3D object is represented on a 2D surface. To create a real scene, objects are drawn smaller to show that they are farther away from the person looking at the artwork. The dimensions of an object are also drawn differently depending where the line of sight is. The size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are usually drawn shorter than dimensions across the line of sight. This is called foreshortening, and is used to create the appearance of three dimensions on a flat surface. Landscape paintings have a horizon line. This line represents objects that are infinitely far away. They have shrunk, in the distance, like objects on the Earth's horizon. Changing the height of the horizon level changes the view point for the picture. A person lying on the ground and looking up would have a different view to a person on a ladder looking down.
Persuasion	Persuasion is a form of influence. It is the way to get people to agree with an idea, [[:wikt:attitude|attitude]], or action by rational and emotional means. It is a problem-solving strategy and relies on "[[:wikt:appeal|appeal]]s" rather than . Dissuasion is the process of convincing someone not to believe or act on something.
Petition	A petition is a request to change some thing. They are often made to a government official or public entity. Petitions to a deity are a form of prayer.
Petrochemical	A petrochemical is a Organic compound product that is made from petroleum, natural gas or other hydrocarbons. Some petrochemicals include alcohol, antiseptics, artificial rubber, detergents, drugs, explosives, food additives, insecticides, perfume, plastic, and textile fiber.
Petroleum product	A petroleum product is an Organic compound made in oil refinery. They result from refining (changing) crude oil (also called Petroleum) into more useful products. Well-known petroleum products include:
Pharmaceutical chemistry	Pharmaceutical chemistry or medicinal chemistry is a discipline of chemistry and pharmacology. Medicinal chemistry is interested in finding out about the chemical properties Medicine have, and about the synthesis and production of drugs. In general, medicinal chemistry is seen as a specialization of organic chemistry. Constantin Zwenger (1814-1885) was the person who founded the field of pharmaceutical chemistry.
Phase change	A phase change is a change in the states of matter. For example, a solid may become a liquid. This phase change is called melting. When a solid changes into a gas, it is called sublimation. When a gas changes into a liquid, it is called condensation. When a liquid changes into a solid, it is called solidification. When a gas changes into a solid, it is called deposition_(phase_transition) . When a liquid changes into gas, it is called evaporation. Phase changes are usually caused by changes in temperature or pressure. As the states of matter change from solid to liquid to gas, respectively, their composition changes as well. For example, in a solid, the chemical bond are stronger than hydrogen bonds. That allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape. However, when the heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid, the bonds are considerably weaker, and in water, are simply hydrogen bonds. A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape, and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is. When more heat is added, the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas, which has no bonds at all. Gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container. If a gas is not confined, the space between the particles will continue to increase. A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. In this pattern, solid to liquid to gas, heat is being added in order to provoke the phase change. In the other "direction," gas to liquid to solid, heat is being released through the phase change. It often helps to think of an ice cube when thinking of phase changes. An ice cube is a solid, and when heated up, it becomes liquid water. When heated up some more, it becomes water vapor, which is a gas.
Phoenician language	Phoenician was a language originally Spoken language in the coastal Mediterranean region then called "Canaan" in Phoenician, Arabic language, Greek language, and Aramaic. It was called "Phoenicia" in Greek language and Latin. The ancient Egyptians called it "Pūt". Phoenician is a Semitic languages of the Canaanite languages subgroup. It is related to the Hebrew language language but was more developed. Phoenician is divided into three groups. Phoenician dates from the 10th century to the 7th century BC. The area where Phoenician was spoken includes modern-day Lebanon, coastal Syria, Palestine, northern Israel and parts of Cyprus. The Phoenician alphabet is the oldest verified consonantal alphabet, or abjad.
Phoneme	Phonemes are the units of sound (speech) which distinguish one word from another in a particular language, they are discrete abstractions. In most Lect (Accent and Dialects of English) of spoken English there are about 24 consonantal phonemes and 20 vowel phonemes (altogether 44 phonemes), but only 26 letters in writing. To learn all the phonemes in English, it would be better to use the International Phonetic Alphabet, which has a unique letter for every phoneme in English, unlike the English alphabet. The development of phonological representations for words and their parts is a major step in learning a spoken language. A good way to learn phonemes in a language is to learn Minimal pair. A minimal pair is a pair of different words that are different by only one sound. An example of this is "bit" and "bat". Even though only the vowel in each word is different, each word has a completely different meaning. Another example is "dip" and "tip", where both words have different meanings even though only the first consonant in each word is different.
Phonetics	Phonetics (from the Greek language word φωνή, phone which means 'sound' or 'voice') is the science of the sounds of human speech. .Someone who is an in phonetics is called a phonetician. Phonetic theory regards the nature of sounds in speech (called Phone (phonetics)) and how they are made, heard and thought of. Phonology, which came from it, studies sound systems and sound units (such as phonemes and distinctive features). Phonetics is one of the two parts of orthographical linguistics, the other part being spelling, differing from grammar and lexis. Phonetics has three main branches:
Photocatalysis	Photocatalysis is using light as a catalyst to increase the rate of a photoreaction. Most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system. Light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds. For example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight. When light breaks the chemical bonds, free radicals are produced. A free radical is a molecule, atom or an ion that needs an electron. The free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions.
Photochemistry	Photochemistry is the study of chemical reactions that go with light. There are many natural examples of such reactions. One is photosynthesis, which is a very important process through which plants form oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Another is making vitamin D in the body. Many times reactions go with heat: as you heat molecules, they start to move around and so hit other molecules which can then react. What molecules need is just some activation energy, a little energy to start the reaction. In the case of photochemistry, this energy is given by the light. A molecule or an atom absorbs at a certain wavelength. If light is given at this wavelength then the molecule or atom becomes excited. It is then easier for it to react. Another way in which light can help reactions go is by changing the symmetry of a molecule. This can be tested with the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Some pericyclic reactions go with heat, some go only with light. In atmospheric chemistry, light is very important. This is because there is much more Ultraviolet at the top of the atmosphere. This allows reactions that don't happen on the ground. For example, ozone can split in an oxygen molecule and one oxygen atom.
Photodissociation	Photodissociation, photolysis, or photodecomposition is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons. One or more photons interact with the target molecule. Photodissociation is not limited to visible light. Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound. Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher, such as ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions. One example where this is used is the Light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis. Far more enegetic photons of ultraviolet light (240 nm and shorter) can break the bonds of oxygen molecules. The newly independent oxygen atoms create ozone in the ozone layer.
Photoflash capacitor	A photo flash capacitor is a capacitor used in the flashes of cameras. A camera flash works by applying short bursts of high voltage to a type of gas in a glass tube. The electrical energy required is small, but it has to be given very fast because since the flash doesn't last long. An ordinary battery cannot give such a high voltage or give it so fast, so a photo flash capacitor is used. An electronic circuit increases the battery voltage, and charges a capacitor. When the button is pressed, the capacitor releases the stored energy in about a thousandth of a second and makes a bright flash.
Photometry (astronomy)	Photometry is a method of problem solving in astronomy. It aims to measure flux. When photometry is performed over broad wavelength bands of radiation, where not only the amount of radiation but also its spectral distribution is measured, the term spectrophotometry is used. The word is combination of the Greek affixes "photo-" ("light") and "-metry" ("measure").
Photomontage	A photomontage is an image made of two or more photographs. It is made by cutting and joining the photographs together into an illusion of subject that is not real. A similar method is used today with Digital camera, using Photo manipulation.
Photosphere	A photosphere is a layer of stars from which light is radiation. It is the deepest region of a star that is transparency to photons of certain wavelengths.
Phototroph	Phototrophs (photo = light, troph = nutrition) or photoautotrophs are organisms which carry out photosynthesis. With their plastids and the help of energy from light, carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugar by photosynthesis. Sugar is then converted into other Organic chemistry molecules which can be used in cell (biology) functions. Such a function might be, for example, respiration.
PhpBB	phpBB is a used, Free software computer software for forums. As the name suggests, phpBB is written in PHP, with the use of one of SQL compatible databases.
Physical abuse	Physical abuse is a form of abuse which causes feelings of pain, injury, or other physical suffering. Physical abuse may lead to low self-esteem and other mental problems.
Physical chemistry	Physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems. It studies them at macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particle levels. It looks at concepts like motion, energy, Force (physics), time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics and Analytical dynamics. Physical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics. Physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra-molecular science. The majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecular/atomic structure alone. These include chemical equilibrium and colloids. Some of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of:
Physical unclonable function	Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware modules that can generate randomness. Their operation is based on "locked" randomness, stemming from tiny imperfections (mistakes) in the manufacturing process of hardware, which result in the production (output) of a bit-string which appears random and can be considered as unique per hardware instance (device). Essentially, in each PUF circuit, electric current may move through this circuit in two distinct ways/paths, such as two wires. If it goes mostly through one of these ways/paths, a Binary number is produced, whereas if it goes through the other way/path, a truth value is produced. The prevalent path is chosen according to tiny details (characteristics) of the circuit, such as which wire is thicker or longer. However, the two wires have been designed to be exactly the same, and only differ because of imperfections of the manufacturing process, which cause random tiny mistakes (imperfections), such as one wire being 5 Millimetre, and the other 5.00001 Millimetre. Therefore, and as the choice of the prevalent path is dependent on a large number of tiny details (thickness, length, Electrical resistance of the wires, etc.), which are very difficult to determine beforehand, this choice appears as random, and can be considered as chaos. The tiny production mistakes that affect the path choice cannot be predicted as they happen randomly in the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, after they happen, they stay like that, for example, the small difference in length between two wires will always exist after they have been manufactured, so the aforementioned path choice is "locked", although it is "random" (chaotic), and will always give the same result. Since most contemporary hardware devices consist of millions of circuits, millions of individual choices can be made at the same time, resulting in a string (series) of bits (zeros and ones) of a very large length. Since each choice is independent and "random", the probability that two such strings will be the same becomes extremely small due to their very large length. Therefore, a PUF can be used to produce a large bit-string that will be unique per device and always the same, when measured under exactly the same conditions. Such a bit string can then be used in cryptography as an inherently occurring cryptographic token, such as a key for encryption. As external (environmental) conditions may affect the result of a PUF (its "random" unique bit-string output), error correction may be needed to force this result to be the same between different measurements. Hardware, which by its nature allows for a choice of path for electricity, such as memory cells, can be easily employed in order to implement a PUF in a device, without the need of additional circuitry. Therefore, PUFs can be quite cost-efficient and lightweight.
Pi	The number () is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts as 3.141592653589793... and continues without end. Numbers like this are called Irrational number numbers. The diameter is the largest chord which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the circumference. Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles, the number pi remains constant: its value never changes. This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same.
Picture frame	A picture frame is usually a rectangle or oval shaped object designed to hold, protect and display a painting, drawing, or photograph. Most picture frames are made of wood or metal, and may have a glass cover. Some can be attached to walls, while others can stand up on a flat surface. The frames can almost be works of art themselves.
Pidgin (software)	Pidgin (also known as Gaim) is a instant messaging client (computing) that can work on Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. The software can use most Instant Messaging Protocol (computing), which will let the user log into different instant messaging services from one program. The number of Pidgin users is thought to be more than 3 million in 2007.Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Pidgin is free software.
Pietra dura	Pietra dura is a term for using cut and fitted, highly polished colored stones to create images. The stonework is glued stone-by-stone to a base after being "sliced and cut in different shape sections; and then assembled together so precisely that the contact between each section was practically invisible". Stability was achieved by grooving the undersides of the stones so that they interlocked, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, with everything held in place by an encircling 'frame'. Many different colored stones, particularly marbles, were used, along with semiprecious stone, and even gemstone. The technique first appeared in Rome in the 16th century. It reached its peak in Florence. Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones. Typically the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples have the image is in low relief. There are a number of similar techniques which should not be called pietra dura. The English term "Florentine mosaic" is sometimes used for the work of Giovanni Montelatici (1864-1930). He was an Italian Florentine artist whose brilliant work has been distributed across the world by tourists and collectors. Pietra dura is also different from mosaics because stones are mostly much larger and cut to a shape suiting their place in the image, not all of roughly equal size and shape as in mosaic. In pietra dura, the stones are not cemented together with grout, and works in pietra dura are often portable. Nor should it be confused with micromosaics, a form of mosaic using very small tesserae of the same size to create images for Byzantine icons, and later for furniture panels.
Piezoelectricity	Piezoelectric material generates a small electrical voltage, when its shape is deformed. This can be by as little as a 0.09% change, and can produce 12mAh worth of electricity at 230V (standard power output). It is important to note that the actual values of a piezoelectric material's volume or surface area do not change, as only the ratios of each axis (x, y and z) that are altered. E.g. a cuboid with 20 meters cubed volume can have the normal dimensions 1 meter by 2 meters by 10 meters, and the deformed dimensions 2 meters by 2.5 meters by 4 meters; the volume would remain the same, . When processed, the piezoelectric crystal become sharper as they get refined through heating and cooling. This process makes the material much more sensitive to changes in pressure, as well as increases their resistance to compressive stress that would impede its ability to function.
Pillar tomb	A pillar tomb is a tomb which is dominated by a single pillar or column, which is usually made of stone.
Pin stripes	Pin stripes are a pattern of very thin running in parallel found in cloth. Although pin stripes are found in mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pin striped. In baseball, the Chicago Cubs baseball uniforms have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to have pin striping onto a baseball uniform. Many other Major League Baseball teams like the Montreal Expos and New York Yankees later put pin stripes on their own uniforms.
Pipelight	Pipelight is a compatibility layer that allows NPAPI plugins for Microsoft Windows to be used on Linux. It is a modified version of Wine (software). Silverlight, Adobe Flash Player, Unity (game engine) and Widevine run. More plugins, such as Adobe Shockwave, run experimentally. The web browser must be able to use NPAPI plugins. Some web browsers (notably newer versions of Google Chrome and Opera (web browser), and Firefox 52 and later) are not.
Pixelization	Pixelization is a way of hiding information from a picture. It is often used to censorship pictures or movies that are inappropriate. It is also used to hide someone's face if they do not wish to be seen.
Plagiarism	Plagiarism is copying another person's ideas, words or writing and pretending that they are one's own work. It can involve violating copyright laws. College students who are caught plagiarizing can be led from school. It can ly damage a student's reputation. Writers who plagiarize commit serious legal and Ethics violations.<ref name=sixconsequences/>
Plaintext	In cryptography, plaintext is the information which the sender want to transmit to the receiver(s). Before computers, plaintext meant text in the language of the communicating parties. Since computers, the definition has been expanded. It now includes not only the electronic representation of text, such as emails and word processor documents, but also the computer representation of speech, music, pictures, videos, Automated teller machine and credit card transactions, sensor data, and so forth. That is basically any information which the communicating parties might wish to hide from others. The plaintext is the normal representation of the data before any action has been taken to hide it. The plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is termed ciphertext. Some systems, however, use a cascade of layers of encryption (called 'rounds') in which case the ciphertext output of one encryption algorithm becomes the plaintext input to the next. Triple DES is an example.
Plan view	A plan view is an orthographic projection of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a horizontal Plane (mathematics) through the object. In other words, a plan is a Cross section (geometry) viewed from the top. In such views, the portion of the object above the plane is omitted to reveal what lies beyond. In the case of a floor plan, the roof and upper part of the walls may be left out. Basically, a plan view is just another name for the top view of a 3D object.
Planetary science	Planetary science (or planetology) is the organized study of planets, which are relatively large, stable bodies in orbits around stars. The planet best known to us is the Earth. There are seven other major planets in the Solar System. The Solar System also has dwarf planets, such as Pluto and Ceres, the largest asteroid. Space probes have gone near or landed on all planets in our solar system. In recent decades better telescopes have found planets in solar systems other than our own, which are known as exoplanets. One of the first was a planet found to be orbiting Barnard's star. Planetary science is a part of astronomy and geology. It is sometimes referred to as planetary geology. Planetary science in a broad sense includes finding a planet's orbital period and orbital distance from its star, the mineral makeup of the planet, and an attempt to learn its age. It may also have a more narrow focus, such as the mapping of the planet's surface features and the makeup of its atmosphere.
Planform	In design planform or plan view is a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal Plane (mathematics), like a map. In aviation, a planform is the shape and layout of an fixed-wing aircraft's wing. Of all the myriad planforms used, they can typically be grouped into those used for low-speed flight, found on general aviation aircraft, and those used forhigh-speed flight, found on many military aircraft and airliners.
Planisphere	In astronomy, a planisphere is a Projection (mathematics) of the celestial sphere onto a Plane (mathematics). Because of the projection, certain parts of the celestial sphere cannot be shown. Hipparchus discovered that it was possible to do a projection which keeps the Angle intact.
Plankton	Plankton are drifting organisms that live in the surface layers of the ocean. They live in the top layer of the ocean, called the Pelagic zone. They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents. The term is in contrast to nekton, who can control their movements. There are three groups:
Plant breeding	Plant breeding is the art and science of changing the trait (biology) of plants to produce desired characteristics. Plant breeding can be done by many different techniques. Plants with desirable characteristics for propagation can be selected. More complex molecular techniques are also possible (see cultigen and cultivar). Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is now done worldwide by gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centres. International development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for preventing famine. New varieties are developed. They are higher-yielding, resistant to pests and diseases, drought-resistant or adapted to different environments and growing conditions.
Plant cutting	Plant cutting, also known as striking/cloning, is a technique for vegetatively (asexually) Plant propagation. With this method, a piece of the source plant containing at least one stem cell is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil, potting mix, coir or rock wool. The cutting then grows new roots, Plant stems, or both, and becomes a new plant independent of the parent.
Plantation	A plantation is a large farm which is specialized on farming one type of crop. Plantations grow cash crops, mostly for export, and less for local use. Crops grown on plantations include banana, sugarcane, coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco. Some of the problems with plantations come from the fact that they are monocultures, that is there is only one kind of crop that is grown there. This makes them vulnerable to pests, for example.Among the earliest examples of plantations were the latifundia of the Roman Empire. They produced large quantities of wine and olive oil for export. Plantation agriculture grew rapidly with the increase in international trade and the relative decline of subsistence farming. Like every economics, it has changed over time. Earlier forms of plantation agriculture were associated with large disparities of wealth and income, foreign ownership and political influence, and exploitative social systems such as Indentured servant and slavery.
Play therapy	Play therapy is a kind of therapy counseling with playing activities which makes children overcome their psychological difficulties by themselves and helps them to achieve optimum level of development. Young children are usually hard to express their emotion, needs, and thoughts by language, but it can be possible through their play activities. So, play can be children's language to show their state. Also, they can release Stress (medicine), and have self-confidence by playing freely what they want and getting good words from therapists. For therapists, they should know about human development including child development. Also, they need to know to apply different kinds of playing activities for children. But, the most important thing is to have good relationship with the children. There are many kinds of play therapy. There are psychoanalytic play therapy, children-based play therapy, filial play therapy, cognitive behavioral play therapy, developmental play therapy, Adlerian play therapy, sand play, and group play therapy. Those kinds of play therapy can be used successfully for the children between 4 and 6 years old.
Pleading	Pleading is usually the first step in a lawsuit. This is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses. A complaint is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which starts the lawsuit. A complaint lists the relevant allegations of fact which leads to one or more legal causes of action. It also has a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed. This is called an ad quod damnum clause. In some situations, a complaint is called a petition. In this case the party filing a complaint is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity (law), sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a petition or a bill of complaint in chancery.
Plural ignorance	Plural ignorance or pluralistic ignorance is a term which gives a name to a situation where a majority of group members privately reject a , but at the same time, they assume incorrectly that most others accept it. The term describes a context in which "no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes." A context of can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network. A situation of plural ignorance develops when each individual decision-maker in a group of decision-makers does not have the necessary information to solve a problem.
Poet	A poet is someone who writes poetry. Poetry can be written in any language by a poet. Sappho was an Ancient Greece Greek poet. She lived in Lesbos, Greece. She was famous for writing lyric love poems to women. She wrote in the Ancient Greek language language. Famous English language poets are William Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, William Wordsworth, William Blake, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley They wrote in the English language. Their poetry comes in different styles and forms. Often their poetry is Lyric and Rhyme. The most famous American poetry include Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman. They wrote in English. Often their poetry did not rhyme. They lived in the 19th century century in the United States. Later 20th century century American poets include Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton. Modern French poets are Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire. Rimbaud was famous for his poetry collection called “Illuminations.” Baudelaire wrote of beauty, decay, and spirituality in his famous work “Flowers of Evil.” Great Spanish poets are Garcilaso de la Vega Federico García Lorca Antonio Machado, and Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer. Vicente Aleixandre won the Nobel Prize. Three Latin America Latin American poetry won the Nobel prize in the 20th century. They include Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, and Octavio Paz. They wrote in Spanish. Caribbean poets Derek Walcott and Giannina Braschi wrote epic poetry. Winner of the Nobel Prize, Walcott wrote Omeros and In a Green Night in English. Giannina Braschi writes Epic poetry poetry in English, Spanglish (language), and Spanish, including Empire of Dreams Ancient Chinese poets are Wang Wei, Du Fu, and Qu Yuan. They wrote in Chinese language about the nature and man.
Poincaré conjecture	The Poincaré Conjecture is a question about spheres in mathematics. It is named after Henri Poincaré, the France mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904. The sphere (also called the 2-sphere, as it is a 2-dimensional surface, although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point (if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere, it is possible to slide it down to a point). Mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected. Other spaces do not have this property, for example the donut: a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface. Mathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere, in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough (in mathematician terms, that is compact) is in fact the 2-sphere. It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however, as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected. Also, a regular disk (a circle and its interior) is simply connected, but it has an edge (the bounding circle). The conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3-sphere, which is an object living naturally in four dimensions. This question motivated much of modern mathematics, especially in the field of topology. The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician, with methods from geometry, showing that it is indeed true. He was awarded a Fields Medal and the $1 million Millennium Prize for his work, both of which he declined. The Poincaré conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions: this is the generalised Poincaré conjecture. Surprisingly, it was easier to prove the fact for higher-dimensional spheres: In 1960, Smale proved it to be true for the 5-sphere, 6-sphere and higher. In 1982, Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4-sphere, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal.
Point (geometry)	A point is a precise position in Space (physics). Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size to speak of. In geometry, a point has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually represent a point by a small cross 'X' or by a small dot (a small, round shape). Points are always labelled by capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z). It is one of the most fundamental but undefined terms in geometry. In general, two points can be:
Point of view (philosophy)	A point of view is a specific attitude or manner through which a person thinks about something. This figurative usage of the expression dates back to 1760. Every individual's perception or conception upon any particular action. This is known as point of view. This is based on their thought process and  experience in their life. It may change from person to person. Many things may be judged from a personal, traditional or moral point of view (as in "beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). On a large scale, it may be called worldview or philosophy (informally), and is caused by geography, history, religious beliefs and ideology. There are a number of classifications of world views. One approach is to regards world views as caused by human nature.
Poireiton Khunthok	"Poireiton Khunthok" () or "Poireiton Khunthokpa" () (literally, immigration by Poireiton) is an ancient Meitei literary narrative work (Puya (Meitei texts)), describing about the immigration of a band of colonies, led by a man, Poireiton, the prince and younger brother of Thongaren, the god of the underworld kingdom, in the plains of the Ancient Manipur (present day Manipur).It is partially an allegorical work, which includes mythical elements as the integral parts of the saga. It also mentions that the knowledge of the usage of fire was also introduced to the people of Kangleipak by Poireiton.
Police	Police are a group of people whose job is to laws, help with Emergency, solve crimes and protection property. A person who carries out this duty is known as a police officer. They work out of a police station. Police are trained in first aid and , because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are illness or injury, such as a car accident, or a fire.
Police state	Police state is a country where activities of its people are controlled by the government with the help of a strong Police. Many times these governments use a secret police unit to supervise and limit their citizens' activities. Judicial review in a police state either doesn't exist or is regularly manipulated by government officials.
Political freedom	There are different ideas of freedom. In terms of poltics, there are large movements:
Pollinator	A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the pollenizer. To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use. Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads. Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. hoverfly (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments. The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquito, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents. Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.
Pollutant	Pollutants are compounds which are to the environment. They can also be harmful to humans in the long-term range. They come from mineral and fossil sources or are produced by humans themselves. Many pollutants have a poisonous effect on the body. Carbon monoxide is an example of a substance which is damaging to humans. This compound is taken up in the body instead of oxygen. That makes the body and in severe cases may lead to death. Some pollutants became dangerous by reaction with other naturally occurring compounds. The oxides of nitrogen and sulphur are released from impurities in fossil fuels when they are burnt. They react with water vapour in the atmosphere to become acid rain. Acid rain damages buildings and makes lakes unable to support Ocean life, which causes fish and water plants to death.
Polsat Box	Polsat Box is the company of Cyfrowy Polsat's Digital television satellite television services. It replaced the company name identical to platform name in August 2021.
Polymorphism	Polymorphism in biology is when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species. Polymorphism is common in nature. The most common example is sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many organisms.Another example is sickle-cell anaemia. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a population with random mating.
Popular science	If a book or a TV show is about science, and is made easy so everyone can understand, then it is popular science. It is popular because it is made for the whole population, not just for scientists. Nature documentaries are examples of popular science. Popular science is non-fiction, so it is not the same as science fiction. Popular science is also not the same as Science journalism. Science journalism is what journalists write to report the newest theories and discoveries made in science, but popular science is not always about what is newest. Some famous people who make popular science are David Attenborough, Isaac Asimov, Jacob Bronowski, Arthur C. Clarke, Martin Gardner, J.B.S. Haldane, Stephen Hawking, Bill Nye, and Carl Sagan.
Port forwarding	Port forwarding, also referred to as port mapping, is a method of packet forwarding a TCP and UDP port from one Node (networking) to another. This technique can allow an external user to reach a port on a Private network (inside a local area network) from the outside using a Network address translation-enabled router. Port forwarding allows remote computers (e.g. public machines on the Internet) to connect to a specific computer within a private LAN. For example:
Port scanner	A port scanner is an input device for a computer to scan documents or papers using the computer system. This is often used by network administrators to verify security policies of their Computer network and by attackers to find network services running on a host to take advantage of vulnerabilities.
Portfolio management	Portfolio management refers to earning money by putting assets into different types of investments. The idea of portfolio management comes from the portfolio theory. This theory says that a person can reduce the risk of investment by having a portfolio that has different types of security (finance) of which some of them may cause a great return on the investment.
Portrait	A portrait is a painting or a photograph of a person's face and its expression. The purpose of a portrait is to show the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography, a portrait is actually not a snapshot, but a calm image of a person in a still position. A portrait normally shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer.
Portuguese alphabet	The Portuguese alphabet is a Latin alphabet with 26 letters. Also, the language uses accent marks to show sound changes and Syllable stress. The accents used in Portuguese are the acute accent (Áá, Éé, Íí, Óó, Úú), the circumflex (Ââ, Êê, Ôô) and the tilde (Ãã, Õõ). Respectively (in order), the accents mark open, closed and nasal vowels. There are rules that tell when to put an accent in a word. Most of the time, accented syllables are the stressed ones, and some words even have more than one accent, like "órgão", meaning "organ". Lastly, the language has a "ç" character (C with a cedilla, used for historical reasons. It has a /s/ sound like in the word "soap" and it never appears at the very start or at the very end of a word.
Possession	Possession usually means to have some sort of ownership over something else. A person may be in possession of some property, which is legal ownership, under property law. There are some other related uses of the term. When English people explorer, Captain James Cook, claimed the country of Australia as a British country, he took "possession" of the land. The spot where he made his claim on 22 August 1770, a small island in the Torres Strait, is now called Possession Island, Queensland. In some beliefs, to be possessed is to be under the influence of devils, demons, or evil spirits. These people may do evil or terrible things because of their possession.
Postmodernism	Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture, philosophy, art and many other things. The term has been used in many different ways at different times, but there are some things in common. Postmodernism says that there is no real truth. It says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered. Because knowledge is made by people, a person cannot know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are 'believed' instead of 'known'. People believe that they know what the truth is, but they will think that the truth is something different later. This is the opposite of 'objectivity', which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it. Since postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent, people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right. Postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes, because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong. Postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also, it means that they are just trying to have power over them. Starting with the 18th century the enlightenment and into the early 20th century, many people believed that science and new knowledge would make the world better. When scientists or philosophers discovered something new, it would always make society a little bit better. They thought that social progress could not be stopped. Modernism especially believed this. But postmodernism says that there is no real social progress. It says that while some things about the world change, people only want to believe that the world is better than it was. It changes but does not get better, because there is no 'better.' Postmodernism says that since peoples' opinions change, and since one person's opinion cannot be more right than another, it means nothing to say that (for example) one work of art is better than any other. Postmodernism says that art, music, and literature, for example, can be anything that its maker says that it is. Postmodern art and literature commonly talk about themselves and make fun of themselves. They make fun of 'serious' art and even the idea of art. Postmodernism has influenced many cultural fields, including literary criticism, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, architecture, visual arts, and music. The term postmodernism was first commonly used in the 1949 to talk about modern architecture. Many people did not like modern architecture because it had too many box-like shapes and people did not think it was pretty. Some of them started the postmodern architecture movement. Postmodern architecture uses surface ornament, historical reference, and less box-like shapes. Postmodernist ideas can be seen in philosophy, the study of culture and society, literature, architecture, design, as well as in history and law. Postmodernism also led people to think differently about love, marriage, popular culture, and the change in much of the Western world from an industrial society to service economy. The term postmodernity usually means the period of time when postmodern ideas became common (the second half of the 20th century). Some experts think that postmodernism is now over, especially in literature.
Potato blight	Potato blight is the so-called "fungal" disease which destroyed the Ireland potatoes in 1845. Because there are other blights of potatoes, this one is sometimes called late blight of potato. The infestation caused widespread Irish Potato Famine. It was caused by an oomycete Phytophthora infestans. The oomycetes or water moulds have many features which are similar to fungi, but they are in a different Kingdom (biology).
Power consumption	In electrical engineering, power consumption refers to the electrical energy per unit time, supplied to operate something, such as a home appliance. Power consumption is usually measured in units of watts (W) or kilowatts (kW). The energy used by equipment is always more than the energy really needed. This is because no equipment is 100% Energy efficiency. Power is wasted as heat, vibrations and/or electromagnetic radiation. For example, a light bulb does not only convert electric power into light; it also makes some heat.
Power cut	A power cut, sometimes called a power outage or blackout, is a word for when the electric power does not work in an area. It is sometimes caused by a power line (or electricity cable) falling down, but may also happen due to routine maintenance. In poor countries, such as many in Africa, there are regular power cuts as more people try to use the electricity than there is to go around. An uninterruptible power supply can protect sensitive equipment such as computers or other electronics during a power cut, allowing it to be properly shut down.
Power factor	In electricity, the power factor (PF or cosφ) is the ratio between the power that can be used in electric circuit (real power, P) and the power from the result of multiplication between the Electrical current and voltage circuit (apparent power, S). The power factor is defined as:
Power station	A power station (or power plant) is a place where electricity is produced. Most do this by a big spinning electrical generator. In big powers stations the spinning is usually driven by a steam turbine. The steam may come from:
Power supply unit	A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains alternating current to low-voltage regulated direct current power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers always use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.
Power system harmonics	Power system harmonics are the harmonic contents from the utility frequency. Harmonics are one kind of to a voltage or Electric current's waveform. This distortion is produced by Nonlinear system devices connected to the power system. Since equipment is made to work at the utility frequency, harmonics can make it work wrong. This is one kind of power quality problem. It increases heating in power equipment. Harmonics can be eliminated or reduced by using Filter (electronics).
Power system protection	Power system protection is part of an electric power system. It protects an electrical network from faults by isolating the faulted parts from the healthy parts. This keeps the power system working as much as possible.
Pre-shared key	In cryptography, a pre-shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used. Such systems almost always use Symmetric-key algorithm cryptographic algorithms. The characteristics of this shared secret or Key (cryptography) are determined by the system which uses it; some system require that such keys be in a specific format. It can be a password like 'bret13i', a passphrase like 'Idaho hung gear id gene', or a hexadecimal string like '65E4 E556 8622 EEE1'. The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems. The term is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy or Wi-Fi Protected Access, where both the Access point and all clients share the same key. Since one weakpoint of the Cryptosystem is the encryption algorithm's Key (cryptography), the Key strengthening is important, and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key size, it is important to choose a key whose length is Brute force attack (see password strength). There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key. The Diceware is one example.
Precision Approach Path Indicator	The Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) is a visual system next to the touch-point on a runway. The purpose of the system is to lead a plane in correct approach. The PAPI creates ray of light which gives pilot information about his actual height. Principle:
Predator-prey equations	The predator-prey equations is an ecological system of two linked Equation that models two species that depend on each other: One is the prey, which provides food for the other, the predator. Both prey and predator populations grow if conditions are right. Alfred J. Lotka found these equations in 1925. Vito Volterra found them, independently, in 1926. For this reason, the equations are also called Lotka-Volterra equations. The equations themselves are non-linear Differential equation. There are a number of pre-conditions
Premium economy	Premium economy is a travel class offered on some airlines to give better experience than economy class but for much less money than business class. In 1991, EVA Air became the first airline company to offer such a service. The Premium economy class is not regulated among airlines, and can be much different between airlines and routes. Premium economy is often limited to just small extras like more leg room, free meal and drinks.<ref name="cnn2011"/>
Prequel	Prequel is a term in drama and literature: it means the opposite of sequel. When a story is told in several stages, it is natural to tell it in order of time. For example, a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s, and ended up in 1946. For various reasons, this does not always happen. In the movie series Star Wars, the first movie was [[Star Wars Episode IV:A New Hope]] (1977). It was followed by three prequels, which were [[Star Wars Episode I:The Phantom Menace]] (1999); [[Star Wars Episode II:Attack of the Clones]] (2002) and [[Star Wars Episode III:Revenge of the Sith]] (2005). For correct use, the term 'prequel' is only applied when work is part of a series, and when the later publication refers to an earlier time. It is an old idea, but one which is often used today for drama on movie and television. The Cypria, a work of Ancient Greek theatre literature, is a prequel to Homer's Iliad. A related idea is the back-story, which is the background story of a main story or character.
Presentation software	A presentation software is a computer software package used to show information, normally in the form of a Slideshow. It mostly includes three major functions: an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted, a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images and a slide-show system to display the content. The most commonly known presentation program is Microsoft PowerPoint, but there are alternatives such as OpenOffice.org, Apple's Keynote (software), LaTeX Beamer and WPS Office (Free and complete office suite, includes writer, spreadsheet, presentations, enjoys the features of small-size, easy-to-use and compatible, covering multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, Android, iOS and Mac). Originally these programs were used to generate 35 mm slides, to be presented using a slide projector. As these programs became more common in the late 1980s, several companies set up services that would accept the shows on floppy disk and create slides or print Transparency. In the 1990s, dedicated Liquid crystal display-based screens that could be placed on the projectors started to replace the transparencies, and by the late 1990s they had almost all been replaced by video projectors.
Presidential portrait (United States)	An Official Presidential Portrait is an oil portrait painted of a President of the United States of America. In recent years, the official portrait of the President is a photograph until after they leave office. The tradition started with Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington. Presidents often display the official portraits of Presidents they admire (on loan from the National Portrait Gallery (United States)) in the Oval Office, or around the White House.
Presumption of innocence	The presumption of innocence, is sometimes referred to by the Latin expression Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies). It is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. In many nations, presumption of innocence is a legal Rights of the accused in a Trial. It is also regarded as an international human rights law under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11. and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14. This places the Legal burden of proof on the Prosecutor. They have to collect and present enough compelling evidence to convince the trier of fact (a jury or judge) that the accused is Guilt (law) beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused is to be [[Wikt:acquit|acquit]]ted. Under Corpus Juris Civilis and English Common law, the accused is presumed innocent in Criminal law. In Civil law (like breach of contract) both sides must issue proof. Under Anglo-American Common Law, the accused is always presumed innocent in all types of proceedings. Proof is always the [[Wikt:burden|burden]] of the accuser. Sharia law, also called Islamic Law, is the third least common type of law in the world. It also has a presumption of innocence.<ref name=Ziegler/>
Pretty Good Privacy	Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a computer program that provides Cryptography [[WP:PRIVACY|privacy]] and authentication. PGP is often used for Digital signature, Encryption and Decryption electronic mails (e-mails) to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was originally created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991. PGP and other similar products follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.
Preview	A preview is a small piece of something used to show what the whole is like before it is generally available. Typically, previews exist for movies and possibly video games. They usually are a small portion of video showing what the game or movie is like to advertising it. In software, a preview can be a feature that allows a [[:wikt:user|user]] to see what a document looks like before the user prints it out, or posts it on a website.
Primary and secondary legislation	In the parliamentary systems of government, primary legislation and secondary legislation are two forms of law. Primary legislation consists of Act of Parliament or statute. Secondary legislation (also called delegated legislation) is the granting of additional law-making powers to another branch of government by an Act or statute. In the European Union, primary and secondary legislation are two of the three processes of law. The third is supplementary law which includes International law and covers any gaps between primary and secondary legislation.
Primary production	Primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide. It occurs by photosynthesis. Light is its source of energy. It also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy. Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs. They form the base of the food chain. On land, these are mainly plants; in the sea (or lakes) algae do this role. Also, there are shallow water oxygen primary producers like sea grass. By photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, energy is used to make complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds (such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The following are simplified equations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) chemosynthesis (bottom):
Primatologist	Primatology is the study of nonhuman primates. It is a diverse discipline, and primatologists can be found in biology, anthropology, psychology and other departments.
Primetime	Primetime (also known as prime time) is a timeslot on most networks running from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time Zone (North America) and 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. Central Time Zone and Mountain Time Zone. It is the most watched timeslot on television. It is before late night television.
Primogeniture	Primogeniture is the system of inheritance by the , usually the eldest son. In feudal England and other legal systems, the Legitimacy first-born son gets the first right to inherit property. His claim is stronger than all daughters, younger sons and even elder illegitimate sons. The rule is that the eldest will always have the first claim. If there is no son, each of the daughters inherit an equal share of the estate (law).<ref name=LII/> If there are no children, the property is often inherited by the eldest brother. Among siblings, sons inherit before daughters and so on. Primogeniture is Latin for "first born".
Privacy	Privacy is the ability of a person or group of people to hide information about themselves. It is also how people choose what information about themselves they want to share. Many countries have laws about privacy. Some laws and constitutions protect privacy, such as the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Other laws limit privacy. For example, taxation laws force people to share information about income with the government. Company can also encourage people to share information about themselves in exchange for money or other benefits.
Private bill	A Private bill is a proposal for a law that would apply to just a person or a group of individuals. This is unlike public law which applies to everyone within its jurisdiction.
Private equity	Private equity is investment in Stock outside a stock exchange. Investors, often from institutions like funds, give a company money, and in turn buy part of that company. The most common types of private equity are: leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. In leveraged buyouts, investors buy the majority control of a mature company. In venture capital or growth capital investment, investors give money to start-up companies.
Private network	In Internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private IP address space, following the RFC 1918 standard. Computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an Intranet network (internal private computer network that uses the Internet Protocol). Private networks are quite common in home and office local area network (LAN) designs, as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique IP addresses for every computer, computer printer and other devices that the organizations use. Private IP addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered IP addresses created by the Internet Protocol standard. One of the reasons Internet Protocol was created is to overcome this limitation of the Internet Protocol standard. However Internet Protocol still did not achieve a widespread use. Routers on the Internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private IP addresses in the IP packet header. This isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses. As connections cannot be made between different private networks via the internet, different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts (communications accidents caused by reaching a third party using the same IP address). If a device on a private network needs to communicate with other networks, a "mediating gateway" (in-between gateway) is needed to ensure that the outside network is presented with an address that is "real" (or publicly reachable) so that Internet routers allow the communication. This gateway is typically a network address translation device or a proxy server. Public Internet Routers by default will not forward packets with RFC 1918 addresses. Unlike public Internet routers that need additional configuration to forward these packets, internal routers do not need any additional configuration to forward these packets. This can cause problems, however, when organizations try to connect networks that both use the same private address spaces. There is a potential for clashes and routing problems if both networks use the same IP addresses for their private networks, or if both networks depend on NAT to connect them through the Internet.
Pro-choice	Pro-choice is the view that a woman should have the right to decide whether or not to have an abortion and that there should not be laws that stop people from getting abortions. People who are pro-choice believe that people should be able to use abortion to end a pregnancy. The view that abortion should be against the law is called pro-life. The pro-choice movement is sometimes called the abortion rights movement. It is largely based on the belief, that woman should be able to decide what they want to do with their bodies. Having a baby would be a huge invasion to the body and should be a choice. They believe that an unborn embryo should not be valued over the pregnant woman. Pro-choice believes in a woman's right to choose.
Probate	Probate is the legal process through which the Will (law) of a deceased person is accepted and handled by a court. The probate process includes confirming that the will, paying the deceased person's debts, and distributing the deceased person's money and property as directed by the will. In many Jurisdiction the court where probate take place is called a probate court. The probate process includes the following steps:
Product (chemistry)	A product is the result of a chemical reaction. An example:H+ + H2O -> H3O+where H3O+ is the product
Product cipher	In cryptography, a product cipher is a popular type of stream ciphers that works by executing in sequence a number of simple transformations such as Substitution cipher, Transposition cipher, and modular arithmetic. Product ciphers usually consist of iterations of several rounds of the same algorithm. Individual rounds themselves are not secure. However, it is hoped that a sufficiently long chain of rounds loads the cipher with sufficient confusion and diffusion properties to make it resistant to cryptanalysis. A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP-network. Feistel ciphers are another important class of product ciphers.
Profiling	Profiling is collecting information about someone in order to describe them and/or predict their behaviour and actions. It is often used for criminals or people believed to behaving illegally. More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success
Programme music	Programme music (or "program music" in US English) is music for Musical instrument which describes something or tells a story. It is the opposite of "absolute music" which is not trying to describe anything, just the sound of the piece. Programme music was very popular in the 19th century although some programme music was written earlier.
Project Athena	Project Athena was a joint project of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Digital Equipment Corporation, and IBM. It was launched in 1983, and research and development continued until June 30, 1991, eight years after it began. It is widely believed that the goals were to create a computing environment that would utilize up to 1,000 workstations but in fact, the goal was to improve the quality of education delivered by the University. The concept that a user could go to any workstation and access any Computer file or Computer program without finding major differences in the user interface and service, just like browsing the Internet today. The project created many technology that are widely used today, such as the X Window System and Kerberos (protocol).
Promise	When a person agreement to do something or to not do something, that person is making a promise. A promise can be made (by saying it), or it can be writing down as a contract. Breaking a promise, or not keeping it, is often just bad manners, but it can sometimes be illegal, such as when a contract is not kept. A vow is a special promise. It is mostly used in a religious sense or in ceremony such as marriages when the couple who are being married make their "marriage vows", promising to be faithful to one another. An oath is a promise in the legal sense. When someone has to give evidence in a court of law they "swear an oath". This means that they promise they will tell the truth.
Proof-of-work system	A proof-of-work (POW) system is a system where finding a solution to a given problem is difficult and/or expensive, but verifying the solution to the given problem is simple and/or cheap.
Propaganda	Propaganda is a form of communication to distribute information. It is always biased. The information is designed to make people feel a certain way or to believe a certain thing. The information is often political. It is hard to tell whether the information is true or false. Very often, the information is confusing and unfair. Propaganda does tend to make disputes last longer, and be more difficult to resolve. It can take the form of posters, Television advertisements, and radio announcements. The word 'propaganda' comes from Latin language. At first, it meant 'ideas to be spread around'. But in the World War I, it came to mean political ideas that are supposed to be misleading. Propaganda is like advertising in some ways. For example, it uses the mass media to spread its ideas. But advertising is usually trying Sales something, whereas propaganda is about ideas. It is often political, and used by states or political parties, not private companies.
Propeller	A propeller makes an airplane, ship, or submarine in water or air go by making a big wind or a strong stream. It does this by turning two or more wings very quick. The blades of a propeller act as rotating wings, and produce force through application of both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's laws of motion, generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades.
Property law	Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the Civil law (legal system) system, there is a division between Movable property and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, United States Treasury security, copyrights and patents.<ref name=Farlex/>
Property tax	A property tax (or millage tax) is a on property that the Ownership is required to pay. The tax is d by the Government authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The tax may be paid to a national, state, province, county, regional, or Local government governmant. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. This is in contrast to a Renting or mortgage tax, which is based on a percentage of the rent or mortgage value. There are four broad types of property: land, immovable property, personal property and intellectual property. Real property (also called real estate or realty) means the combination of land and . Under a property tax system, the government requires and/or performs an Real estate appraisal of the Value of each property. A tax is assessed based on that value. Forms of property tax used vary among countries and jurisdictions. Real property is often taxed based on its . Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use. Properties in different classes are taxed at different rates (tax). Examples of different classes of property are , commerce, industrial and real property. In Israel, for example, property tax rates are double for vacant apartments versus apartments. In the Canadian province of British Columbia a speculation tax on residential properties has been introduced in 2019. A special assessment tax is sometimes confused with property tax. These are two distinct forms of taxation: one (Ad valorem tax Ad valorem tax) relies upon the appraised fair market value of the property being taxed. The other (special assessment) relies upon a special enhancement called a "benefit" for its justification. The property tax rate is often given as a percentage. It may also be expressed as a per mille (amount of tax per thousand currency units of property value), which is also known as a millage rate or mill (which is also one-thousandth of a currency unit). To the property tax, the authority will multiply the assessed value of the property by the mill rate. Then they will divide by 1,000. For example, a property with an assessed value of $50,000 located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of $1,000 per year.<ref></ref>
Proprietary software	Proprietary software (or closed source software) does not let people see or change source code of the computer software. It is the opposite of free software. Proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software, but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them. With proprietary software, only the people that make the software can see and change the code. Even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people, the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these:
Protected area	Protected areas or conservation areas are locations with special protection. They are protected because of their recognized natural, ecology or cultural importance. Areas are usually protected by law. The law can be local, from the country of the protected area, or even . Protected areas are important for biodiversity. They often provide an area safe from hunting or changes to the environment. This provides a safe habitat for threatened and endangered species. They are also important to protect naturally formed areas, like the Grand Canyon, from damage by humans. There are many types of protected areas. One type is a marine protected area. A marine protected area is for seas, oceans, estuary or large lakes. Northeast Greenland National Park is an example of a protected area. The park protects a large variety of animals, such as musk oxen, walrus, and King Eider. Another example of a protected area is the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. This area is protected because it is an important archaeological site.
Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act	On July 28, 2011, the United States United States House Committee on the Judiciary passed the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 (HR 1981). The bill passed by a vote of 19-10. Next the bill will be discussed in the House of Representatives. Some people are against this bill because it gives a lot of access to personal information. Some people have said that the bill will not become a law, but the Congressional Budget Office put out a report on October 12, 2011, with the cost of making the changes in the bill.<ref name="CBO"/> The next step is that the bill will be discussed in the United States House of Representatives.
Protologism	A protologism is a brand new word. Most people don't know about the word after its creation. Only a tiny group of people have ever used the word. Sometimes the coiner is the only person who has ever used the word. Sometimes people create protologisms because of a gap in the language.
Protonation	Protonation is the addition of a hydrogen ion to a substance. A hydrogen atom normally contains 1 proton and 1 electron. When the hydrogen atom is oxidation, it loses its electron, leaving a H+. The H+ is the same as a proton. Substances are protonated when hydrogen ions are added to them. For example, when ammonia (NH3) is protonated, it forms ammonium ions, NH4+. A substance is protonated by a substance more acid than it. The acidic substance is deprotonation.
Protractor	The protractor is a tool used to measure angles in Degree (angle). It usually has marks with labels of the Degree (angle).
Provenance	Provenance, from the French provenir, "to come from", refers to the history of ownership, or the position of a historical object. The term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help Authentication objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of Document. In archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to provenance. Archaeological researchers use provenience to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas provenance covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery.
Proverb	A proverb is a Wisdom saying. Many cultures have collections of these, such as the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament, was said to be written by king Solomon of Israel.A proverb is basically a wise saying.
Proxy server	In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (computing) (computer) which clients (people or computers) use to access other computers. A proxy server that passes information to its clients without changing it is usually called a gateway (computer networking) or sometimes called tunneling proxy. Proxy servers get their name because they act like a (a stand-in) and act on behalf of a Client's computer. A client that connects to the proxy server will ask for some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, that is available on a different server. The proxy server then goes to the other server and asks for what the client wants for them. A proxy server can change the information that it gives to the client, and if the same information is accessed many times or by many different clients it can use what is called a cache to make things faster. A cache is the term for information that has been accessed and saved for future use; if a proxy server has what the client is accessing in its cache, it will make it faster because it does not need to go and access the other server to provide what the client wants. A proxy server can be placed anywhere in the connection between the client and the server, which could include software on the client computer itself or on any computer between. Some proxy servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to secure the connection between the client and the remote server. This security layer helps to make sure that no other computers can read or understand what the client is asking from the server.
Psyche (psychology)	The psyche is the human mind, Consciousness and Unconscious mind. The word has a long history, going back to the ancient Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato. It was used in older psychology and philosophy as meaning the source or cause of human nature. It is not a scientific term, but the word "psychology" is derived from it. The English word soul was sometimes used synonymously in older texts. In modern times the word is used as a synonym of mind.
Psychoanalysis	Psychoanalysis is a field of study of psychology and therapy. It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children. The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:
Psychological abuse	Psychological abuse may also be called psychological violence, emotional abuse or mental abuse. It is when a person puts another person under abuse which may result in psychological trauma. The abuse may result in anxiety disorder, chronic Depression (mood), or post-traumatic stress disorder. This kind of behaviour is an extreme kind of bullying. This abuse happens most often when one person has power over another.It may result in Narcissistic personality disorder, Depression (mental illness), Anxiety disorder, and other disorders. The term does not mean physical abuse. The most common thing to happen is verbal abuse. Blaming, shaming, and name calling are signs of verbal abuse which can affect a victim emotionally.
Psychological nativism	In psychology, nativism is a theory that says that most basic skills are hard-wired in the brain at birth. This theory is the opposite of the theory called the blank slate, or tabula rasa. Blank slate theories said that humans have almost no skills or abilities at birth: they learn these skills over the course of their life. People who believe in nativism (within certain limits) include Jerry Fodor, Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. These psychology believe that humans are born with a set of abilities that help them learn other skills, such as speech. Some mammals do seem to heredity emotional reactions. Monkeys fearing snakes is an example. Most of the behaviour of insects, reptiles and birds is inherited in some detail. Mammals, however, show a greater ability for learning than other kinds of animals. Charles Darwin, in The expression of emotions in man and animals (1872), showed that the way most emotions were shown was common between human cultures. He said this was inherited and had been the result of evolution. Behaviorism says that man's behaviour is affected by its results (operant conditioning). Behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours, instincts, or an inherited to behave. People who believe in evolutionary psychology think this is wrong. They think human behaviour has deep roots in our evolutionary past.
Psychological test	Psychological testing of the modern type started about 150 years ago. Francis Galton (1822–1911) invented the first tests. The American psychologist James Cattell (1860–1944) studied with Galton and then, in 1890, published a classic paper Mental Tests and Measurements. The definition of a psychological test is "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior". The kind of tests which were developed included:
Psychological trauma	Psychological trauma is damage to the psyche (psychology) that happens after a stress (psychological) event. It can be caused by things that make a person fear. Common causes include , sexual abuse, bullying, and domestic violence. Living with any of those for a long time can cause psychological trauma. People who have suffered psychological trauma, particularly in childhood and adolescence, are more likely to have psychological problems. Those problems can include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder.
Psychological warfare	The term psychological warfare is used to describe methods that military use in war-time. We may understand it as an attempt to influence the behavior/beliefs of enemy armed forces and/or foreign civilian populations. Psychological warfare has many similarities with propaganda messages.
Psychology	Psychology is the study of the mind. The study also covers Thought, Emotion, and Behaviour. It also falls under the Academia domain; some parts of psychology follow the way of doing science: explains the mind, how it works, and what it shows through our actions. When doing psychology, it has to deal with Human most of the time but Animal beyond humans at some point. People, experts or not, can't study psychology as a whole. So, we divide small parts of it one step at a time. Also, psychology has much in common with other fields that they overlap with one another. Some of these fields fall in natural sciences or not. Psychologist practice the field in the profession; they undergo long years of schooling than laypeople. These attempt to explain how minds function in the self (individual) and self with others (social). These attempts might also deal with how the body's way affects the mind--its processes and approaches. They can also be scientists in the field of Social sciences, Behaviorism, and Cognitive science.
Psychometrics	Psychometrics is a science that tries to measurement educational and psychology levels of people and groups of people. Areas that are studied in people include intelligence, skills, and personality traits. The science is mainly a part of the science of psychology.
Psychoneuroimmunology	Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body. PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach. The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the central nervous system and immune systems and the relationships between mental processes and health.
Psychopathology	Psychopathology is the study of mental illnesses. It was started by Karl Jaspers in 1913.
Public figure	A public figure is a legal term applied in the context of defamation actions (libel and slander), as well as invasion of privacy. A public figure (such as a politician, musician, celebrity, or business leader) cannot base a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with malice (knowledge or reckless disregard for the truth). The burden of proof is higher in the case of a public figure.
Public interest	Public interest is a term meaning something that s all the people. This is compared to a interest that only benefits one person. Something that is in the public interest is something that concerns the general public. It is something governments , and . The term can also be in its use. For example, 'public interest' can be used by governments for the purpose of state secrecy. It can also be d to mean something that actually serves private interests.
Public journal	Public journal (official gazette, official journal, or official diary) is the daily record of the work of an official organization, especially of legislatures of countries and/or its administrative divisions. Journals of this sort are also often called gazettes (state or government newspapers). In some countries, the publication in the official journal is a for a law to "come into effect" or "come into force" (in which the law becomes a reality), so that people know the law (or treaty) exists, which generally releases it into the public domain. But sometimes a public journal is not always released into the public domain.
Public speaking	Public speaking is speaking to a group of people in an organized way: to give information, influence or persuade, or to Entertainment the . In public speaking there are five important questions, which are often expressed as "who is saying what to whom, using which medium, with what effects?" The Ancient Greeks called public speaking rhetoric; the Romans called it oratory. Until the late 20th century it was also called forensic speaking, or forensics. Propaganda is an another name for speech for or against some point of view. In George Orwell's words propaganda is a reflection of prejudices and beliefs that colors people's [or societies] aesthetic judgements. Often they are simply fallacy or conjectures.
Public-key cryptography	Public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography, is a communication where people exchange messages that can only be read by one another. In public key cryptography, each user has a pair of Key (cryptography):
Punitive damages	Punitive damages are a remedy given by a court in a lawsuit. It is used when a court believes that the defendant needs more punishment to be reformed or stopped from doing the action that caused them to be sued.
Puppet (software)	Puppet is an open source software configuration management and deployment tool. Puppet is said to change the human workflow, and enable developers and system administrators to work together. In October 2017, Puppet unveiled a new product of its own, a hybrid infrastructure tool Puppet Discovery.
PyMOL	PyMOL is an open source program for the viewing and manipulation of data from proteins and other biological molecules. PyMOL is written in the Python programming language.
Pygmalion effect	Pygmalion was a sculptor who lived in Cyprus. Women who lived on Cyprus didn't stay virtue, so Pygmalion decided to live alone and made a sculpture, Galatea. During the Aphrodite feast, thanks to Pygmalion`s prayers, the sculpture turned into a real person. This was called The Pygmalion effect. The Pygmalion effect shows that if we want something enough, we'll get it. It is named after the scholar who demonstrated it. It is also called "Rosenthal Effect" and is quoted when we refer to The power of affirmation and The power of praise. Another example of the Pygmalion effect is in groups. If there are two groups, one group thought that their teacher was "good", the other group thought he was "not good". The teacher treated both groups the same, but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others; Simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students. The Pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory. It makes managers be aware, that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification, personal qualities or working environment. Manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results. In such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work.
Pyrenean Shepherd	The Pyrenean Shepherd is a medium-small breed of dog. It comes from the South of France, in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenean Shepherd is a herding dog. The breed in the northern part of the mountains, where the climate is colder, was originally long-haired and all white. In the Basque area of Spain, the smaller breed of the dog was primarily used to protect the sheep from bear and wolf attacks.
Pythagorean theorem	In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras's theorem is a statement about the sides of a right triangle. One of the angles of a right triangle is always equal to 90 degree (geometry). This angle is the right angle. The two sides next to the right angle are called the legs and the other side is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side opposite to the right angle, and it is always the longest side. It was discovered by Vasudha Arora. The Pythagorean theorem says that the area of a square (geometry) on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs. In this picture, the area of the blue square added to the area of the red square makes the area of the purple square. It was named after the Ancient Greece mathematician Pythagoras: If the lengths of the legs are a and b, and the length of the hypotenuse is c, then, a^2+b^2=c^2. There are many different proofs of this theorem. They fall into four categories:
Qisas	Qisas or Qiṣāṣ () is a term interpreted to mean "retaliation in kind", "eye for an eye", or retributive justice. In historical practice, qisas appears in two forms. One of them is, the punishment of the perpetrator "with the same act" in crimes "committed against the physical integrity of the person, such as a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth". Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person "of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of "social equality" in qisas means that; "if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied", whereas "if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied". In this case, compensation can be paid to the family of the murdered person. The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;: 'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well." In traditional Islamic law (sharia), the doctrine of qisas allows a punishment analogous to the crime. Qisas is available to the victim or victim's Heir against a person convicted of murder or intentional bodily injury. In the case of murder, qisas gives the right to take the life of the killer, if the latter is convicted and the court approves. Those who are entitled to qisas have the option of receiving monetary compensation (diyya) or granting pardon to the person instead.
Quartet	Generally speaking, a quartet is a group of four. In music, a quartet is a group of four people playing or singing four different parts to make a piece of music, such as a string quartet or a barbershop quartet.
Questia Online Library	Questia is a business that gives Online and offline access to a digital library of books and articles. These books and articles have been selected to help students and teachers. It has a lot of books and journal articles about the humanities and social sciences. Most items are under copyright. All the text in all the Questia books and articles is available to subscribers. Google Book Search has 7 million books in their library, but users can only see small parts of copyrighted books.

Qwant	Qwant is a privacy-oriented search engine, originated and hosted in France, and is available in 13 languages.
R-Drive Image	R-Drive Image is disk cloning computer program that can create copies of computer hard drives. This program is developed by R-Tools Technology Inc..
R/K selection theory	r/K selection theory describes the way a species controls its number of offspring. r-selection species produce many offspring. K-selected species focus on a few. Neither method is in itself superior, and they may occur in the same habitat; e.g., rodents (r-selection) and elephants (K-selection). The theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but several studies criticized it. The study of life histories has replaced the r/K selection paradigm. The terminology of r/K-selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, based on their work on island biogeography. Study of the evolution of life history strategies actually has a longer history.
RAS syndrome	RAS syndrome is when someone repeats a part of an acronym after using the acronym, such as Automated teller machine machine.
RC2	In cryptography, RC2 is a symmetric-key algorithm block cipher. Designed by Ron Rivest in 1987. "RC" stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code". RC2 is a block size (cryptography) cipher with a variable key (cryptography) key size and using 18 rounds. Rounds are arranged as a source-heavy Feistel cipher, with 16 rounds of one type called "mixing rounds" Interleaving by two rounds of another type called "mashing rounds". The 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence:
RC4	In cryptography, RC4 (also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is one of the most common software stream ciphers. It is used in popular protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (to secure wireless networks). RC4 is known for being simple and quick, but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed, or one keystream is used twice; some ways of using RC4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as Wired Equivalent Privacy. RC4 was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. While its official name is "Rivest Cipher 4", the RC abbreviation is also known to stand for "Ron's Code" (see also RC2, RC5 and RC6). RC4 was first created as a trade secret, but in September 1994 a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, and from there to many websites on the Internet. The code was confirmed to be genuine(not fake) as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name "RC4" is trademarked, however. RC4 is often referred to as "ARCFOUR" or "ARC4" (meaning Alleged RC4, because RSA Security has never officially released the algorithm), to avoid possible trademark problems. It has become part of some commonly used Cryptographic protocols and standards, including Wired Equivalent Privacy and Wi-Fi Protected Access for wireless cards and Transport Layer Security. The two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of applications are its speed and simplicity. Uses of RC4 in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop. The RC4 encryption algorithm is started with a different Key size, usually between 40 and 256 bits, using the key schedule algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of encryption bits is created using the pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA). RC4 fails the standards set by Cryptanalysis for a secure cipher in many ways, and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC4. Dropping the first kilobyte of data from the keystream can improve the security somewhat.
RC5	In cryptography, RC5 is a simple symmetric-key algorithm block cipher. Designed by Ron Rivest in 1994, RC5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable Block size (cryptography), a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. "RC" stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code". In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels; RC5 has a variable block size (cryptography) (32, 64 or 128 bits), variable key size (0 to 2040 bits) and variable number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds. A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent Permutation box; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptography primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular arithmetic additions and Xors. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel cipher-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the Key (cryptography) using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e (mathematical constant) and the golden ratio as sources of "nothing up my sleeve numbers". The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by Cryptanalysis.
RC6	In cryptography, RC6 is a symmetric-key algorithm block cipher derived from RC5. RC6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable Block size (cryptography), a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. RC stands for "Rivest Cipher", or alternatively, "Ron's Code". In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). RC6 was derived from RC5 to meet the competition requirements, and was selected as one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition, but was not selected as a standard. In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels, RC6 allows choices for the block size (cryptography): 32 bits (for experimentation and evaluation purposes only), 64 bits (for use as a replacement for DES), and 128 bits (intended for AES). The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255, while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size. RC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes. However, RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 and the use of four b/4-bit working registers (see splitting of plaintext blocks in feistel cipher) instead of two b/2-bit registers as in RC5 (b is the Block size (cryptography)). Integer multiplication is used to increase the Confusion and diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increased.The reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for Optimization (computer science) on Bit-level parallelism. The default Block size (cryptography) of RC5 was 64 bits, while the default Block size (cryptography) of the AES is 128 bits. RC5 has only two working registers. It uses 32-bit operations when dealing with Block size (cryptography) and 64-bit operations when dealing with Block size (cryptography), so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only 32-bit operations.<ref name ="What are RC5 and RC6"/> RC6 is a proprietary and patented algorithm (by RSA Security and ), and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm.<ref name ="What are RC5 and RC6"/> It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin, and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects.
RMJM	RMJM is an international architecture and design network. RMJM is an acronym. RMJM stands for "Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall".
ROT13	ROT13 (or ROT-13) is a very simple form of encryption cipher. It is a variant of a Caesar cipher. In it, the alphabet is written in two lines, of 13 characters each. Encryption, and decryption is done by simply switching the letters that are below each other. That way, A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on. It is widely used in USENET forums.
RPG Maker	The RPG Maker is a software which can be used to develop RPG (Role Playing Game) games easily even for people that are not experienced in game design (making games). Until 2003 the program has been created by the Japanese company ASCII. From then on Enterbrain continued the development. The RPG Maker has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which makes operating very simple. The software contains many options to customize a game. Within every version is a Run Time Package (RTP). The RTP contains many different graphics and sounds, although self-created files can be imported into the program as long as they are in the correct format(size, type of file, ...).
RPM Package Manager	RPM Package Manager is a package management system. The name RPM refers to two things: a software package file format, and software packaged in this format. RPM was intended mainly for Linux distributions; the file format RPM is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base.
RSA algorithm	RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encryption and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric Cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different Key (cryptography). This is also called Public-key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private. The algorithm is based on the fact that finding the Factorization of a large composite number is difficult: when the factors are prime numbers, the problem is called prime factorization. It is also a key pair (public and private key) generator. RSA involves a public key and private key. The public key can be known to everyone- it is used to encrypt messages. Messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. The private key needs to be kept secret. Calculating the private key from the public key is very difficult.
Rabi crops	Rabi crops are grown in the winter and harvested in the spring in the South Asia. The word means spring in the Arabic language.
Racial profiling	Racial profiling is a term which originated in the United States. The usual context is police stopping and searching citizens on the suspicion that they may have committed a crime. It is controversial because it is usually black citizens who are stopped and searched. In other countries (for example the Middle East) religious and cultural differences may be the basis of police profiling. Int the USA profiling has been tested in the courts a number of times. Terry v. Ohio was the first challenge to racial profiling in the United States in 1968. This case was about African American people who were thought to be stealing. The police officer arrested the three men, searched them and found a gun on two of the three men. One of the men searched was convicted and sentenced to jail.<ref name=":0" /> The sentence was challenged on the grounds that the arrest violated the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the police officer acted in a reasonable manner, and with reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment.<ref name=":0" /> The decision in this case allowed the police to have discretion in identifying suspicious or illegal activities.
Radio astronomy	Radio astronomy is astronomy which studies Astronomical object at radio frequency. The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the 1930s. Karl Jansky found radiation coming from the Milky Way. Later, other sources of radio emission were found. These include stars and galaxy, as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as Radio galaxy, quasars, pulsars, and Astrophysical maser. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, evidence for the Big Bang, was made through radio astronomy. Radio astronomy is done using large Antenna (radio). These are called radio telescopes. They are used alone, or with multiple linked telescopes. The use of interference allows radio astronomy to achieve high angular resolution. The resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, not the size of its components.
Radioisotope thermoelectric generator	A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (or RTG) is a type of machine that uses heat from radioactive decay to make electricity. The RTG, powered by a radioisotope heater unit, is used in satellites and sometimes in other remote unmanned systems.
Radioresistance	Radioresistance is a property of some living things. It means they can resist the effects of gamma radiation, ultra-violet radiation, and similar types of radiation. A good example is the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. It has enzymes which repair the DNA strands which have been split by the radiation.
Radius	In geometry, the radius of a circle or sphere, written as r, is the shortest connection between the center and the boundary. It is either the distance from the center to the perimeter (in the case of a circle), or the distance from the center to the surface (in the case of a sphere). It is half of the diameter. That is, when r is the radius and d is the diameter: r = d ÷ 2 d = 2 x r = r + r The relationship between the radius and the circumference of a circle is~c = 2\pi r. The area of a circle of radius is
Ragdoll Productions	Ragdoll Productions (or Ragdoll Ltd.) (and Ragdoll Productions Animations.) is a United Kingdom company that produces children's television shows. It was founded by Anne Wood in 1984, who later made many of their successful television series, seen (in the case of Teletubbies) in 111 countries and translated into 41 languages.
Random	Random is a term used in mathematics (and less formally) to mean that there is no way to reliably predict an outcome (to know what will happen before it happens) or sense a pattern. Something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any conscious reason, and therefore thought to be purely by chance. An example of a random event is winning a lottery. A computer can make lists of apparently random numbers. Humans are unable to do this, because the brain works in patterns. If someone is asked to keep saying "heads" or "tails" at random, a smart human observer or properly programmed computer might eventually be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns. On a website such as English Wikipedia the user can click on "Random page" to get a random article. The chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page. Sometimes the word "random" is used more loosely. There are websites of random jokes, which just means: a variety of jokes about all sorts of things. In recent years young people have started to use the word "random" even more loosely to describe anything which is rather strange or has no logic. Sentences such as "the mouldy cheese is escaping" or "I like pie and spam" might be described as "random", although this is not the proper dictionary or mathematical meaning of the word.
Range (biology)	In biology, the range or distribution of a species is the geography area orhabitat where the species live. Sometimes, when species are found in different regions at different times of year, such as summer range and winter range can be used. When discussion about animals, the species' natural range is often discussed. There are at least five types of distribution patterns:
Rangeland	A rangeland is like a pasture. A rangeland can be used for animals to graze on or for whatever the rancher wants.
Ratification	Ratification is the confirmation of a treaty. Treaties are signed by members of the government of a country. Many treaties make a country do something, or change the law of the countries which agree to it. Therefore some countries can only ratify a treaty if it is confirmed by the legislature of the country, or by a referendum (a vote of the people). The founders solved this issue by dropping the Amendment requirements. In the past treaties were signed by delegates chosen by the ruler of a country. To make sure that the treaty was acceptable to the ruler the treaty would not take effect until it was ratified by the ruler. The United States is only bound by a treaty if the Senate agrees. So although President Woodrow Wilson signed the Treaty of Versailles which ended the First World War with Germany and set up the League of Nations the treaty never took effect for the USA because the US Senate never gave its "advice and consent" (agreed) to the treaty. This is why there was a separate peace treaty between Germany and the USA In the United Kingdom the government ratifies treaties, it does not need the agreement of the British House of Commons. However if the treaty is going to change the law then a separate act of parliament is needed. For example before Britain entered the European Union in 1973 the European Communities Act had to be passed to make the changes to the law that were needed.
Rave	A rave is a large party or festival with disc jockeys playing electronic music. Music played at raves include House music, Trance music, techno, drum and bass, dubstep and other forms of electronic dance music (EDM). There is a lot of dancing. Raves also have Laser lighting display, Video projector and other visual effects used to create a fantasy-like scene. Raves mostly developed from acid house music parties in the mid-to-late 1980s in England and Ibiza. From there, it quickly spread to mainland Europe and the United States. Raves are usually organised and promoted by event Company. Some of the early companies promoting raves in England during the 1990s were Fantazia and Helter Skelter. Another was ESP Promotions, which held a series of raves named Dreamscape. In London, there were a few large Nightclub that held raves on a regular basis.
Reactivity (chemistry)	Reactivity is a Measurement of how much a Chemical substance tends to chemical reaction with other things. Some substances are more reactive, and others are less reactive. Reactivity is set by several factors:
Reactivity series	In introductory chemistry, the reactivity series or activity series is an empiricism series of metals, in order of "reactivity" from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the chemical reactions of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores. The elements at a higher level are more reactive, whereas the elements at a lower level are less reactive. The reactivity series reads as follows, starting at the most reactive, going down to the least reactive:
Really Simple Syndication	RSS is a family of Web feed formats used to publish often updated content such as blog entries, news headlines or podcasts. An RSS document, which is called a "feed," "web feed," or "channel," contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with their favorite web sites without having to check them manually. This flow of content between websites and users is called "web syndication". RSS content can be read using software called an "RSS reader," "feed reader" or an "aggregator." The user subscribes to a feed by entering the feed's link into the reader or by clicking an RSS icon in a browser that begins the subscription process. The reader checks the user's subscribed feeds often for new content, downloading any updates that it finds. This content is stored in an standard XML file that many different computers and programs can understand. This file tells the programs how to show the content to the user. The letters "RSS" are used to refer to any of these formats:
Reasonable doubt	Evidence that is beyond a reasonable doubt is the Legal burden of proof required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial system. Generally, the prosecutor has the Legal burden of proof and is required to their Legal case to this standard. This means that the version of events being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "reasonable person" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would not affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty. Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used Synonym with beyond reasonable doubt. But this term extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is most commonly used. If doubt does affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, then the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt". The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country. A related idea is William Blackstone's formulation: "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".
Rechtsstaat	Rechtsstaat is an idea in continental Europe thought. It is that in a country, the state's power is limited by the laws. This might either be the laws agreed upon, or natural law. It is similar to the idea of the rule of law.
Recloser	A recloser is a circuit breaker which can be closed automatically after the breaker has been opened because of Fault (power engineering). Because many faults in power systems fix themselves after they happen, the installation of recloser ensures more continuity of power and higher availability for electricity supply to the load.
Recognition	Recognition, or recognize, is when humans or animals know something about the surrounding objects or beings. For example, an animal might recognize another animal as an enemy or friend, dangerous or harmless. These cognitive acts relate to the beings' perception, memory, learning, and experience.
Recrystallisation	Recrystallization (see also crystallization) is an essentially physical process that has meanings in chemistry, metallurgy and geology. In chemistry, recrystallization is a procedure for purifying chemical compound. A crystal compound often has other compounds on it that make it less useful. To get rid of these extra items, the crystal is placed in a boiling liquid. Soon the crystal solvation. The boiling solution, or the mix of the liquid and the dissolved crystal, gets colder. The crystal will form again. The unwanted compounds stay in the solvent, or the liquid. Now the crystal is pure and made of only the compound. Each type of compound works best in a certain type of liquid. Sometimes two or more liquids mixed together are needed to dissolve a crystal. In geology, solid-state recrystallization is a metamorphism process that occurs under situations of intense temperature and pressure where grains, atoms or molecules of a rock or mineral are packed closer together, creating a new crystal structure.Limestone is a sedimentary rock that undergoes metamorphic recrystallization to form marble, and clays can recrystallize to muscovite mica. In metallurgy, recrystallization is the nucleation and growth of new undeformed grains in a deformed metal. For ice, recrystallization means the growth of larger crystals at the expense of smaller ones. Some biological antifreeze proteins have been shown to inhibit this process, and the effect may be relevant in freezing-tolerant organisms.
Red mercury	Red mercury is a term used for a number of substances that are supposed to exist (or that could possibly exist). So far, no such substance has been found. The chemical element mercury (element) most often occurs in a mixture with Sulphur, as HgS. That mixture is known as Cinnabar, and reddish in color. In pure form, mercury is silver in color. The following assumptions about red mercury have been proved as false:
Reducing agent	A reducing agent is a chemical that gives away electrons to another chemical compound, the oxidizing agent. For example, zinc is a reducing agent. When it s with an oxidation agent, it gives up two electrons, changing its oxidation state from 0 to +2. All chemical elements have an oxidation state of 0.
Reduction (chemistry)	Reduction is a chemical reaction that involves the gaining of electrons by one of the atoms involved in the reaction between two chemicals. The term refers to the element that accepts electrons, as the oxidation state of the element that gains electrons is lowered. An example of a reduction is when iron reacts with oxygen, forming iron oxides such as those called rust. The iron is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced. This is called redox. A blast furnace reverses that reaction, using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent to reduce the iron.
Regional internet registry	A regional Internet registry (RIR) is an organization which is responsible for registering IP addresss in a special part of the world. There are 5 active RIRs in the world:
Regional lockout	Regional lockout is something used to prevent the playing of media for device, sold in another country. It can be programming practice, code, chip, or physical barrier. Regional lockout may be used in movies, video games and computer printers.
Registration	Registration is a method of officially recording something. Usually something is registered to claim more rights, or to protect ownership, or because the law says it must be registered to be used legally. A register was a large book. It was used like a diary to record business dealings or other events.
Regression (psychology)	Regression is a word used in psychology on defense mechanism. It means the act of reversing the ego into an earlier state which allows one to avoid dealing with in a mature manner. A common example of regression is “curling up into a ball” (also known as the fetal position) when stressed, ill, or wounded.
Reincarnation research	Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, from the University of Virginia, interviewed young children who claimed to remember a past life. He did more than 2,500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books, including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation. Stevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years. He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased, attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased's family had occurred. Some 35 per cent of the children examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects. Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children, when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased, provided the best evidence for reincarnation. However, Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation, and cautiously referred to his cases as being "of the reincarnation type" or "suggestive of reincarnation". Stevenson retired in 2002, and psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker took over his work, and wrote [[Life Before Life|Life Before Life:A Scientific Investigation of Children’s Memories of Previous Lives]].
Relative atomic mass	A relative atomic mass (also called atomic weight; symbol: Ar) is a measure of how heavy atoms are. It is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an Chemical element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. In other words, a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12. The word relative in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. Relative atomic mass values are ratios; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity. Relative atomic mass is the same as atomic weight, which is the older term. The number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. However, most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons. For example, the element thallium has two common isotopes: thallium-203 and thallium-205. Both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons, but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons, 2 more than thallium-203, which has 122. Each isotope has its own mass, called its isotopic mass. A relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Like relative atomic mass values, relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units. We can find the relative atomic mass of a sample of an element by working out the abundance-weighted mean of the relative isotopic masses.<ref name=salters /> For example, if a sample of thallium is made up of 30% thallium-203 and 70% thallium-205,
Relaxation	Relaxation is a process or behavior where someone . The goal is to become calmer and less anxiety, Stress (medicine) or angered. Relaxation can also lower muscle tension, blood pressure and slow Heart rate and breath rates, among other health benefits.
Religious law	Religious law comes from the Religious text of various religions. They cover most parts of personal and contract law. Religious laws generally are used in countries that also have other legal systems such as Civil law or common law.<ref name=Hoffman4/>
Renaissance art	Many of the most famous and best-loved works of art in the world were created during the time known as the Renaissance. The Renaissance began about 1400 and lasted until about 1600. Italy, and in particular the city of Florence is thought of as the home of Renaissance art. Many Flemish painters from the area of modern Belgium were also very busy at this time. The style of their pictures, and their use of oil painting influenced the Italian painters.
Repeal	A repeal is the [[Wikt:remove|removal]] or [[Wikt:reverse|reversal]] of a law. There are two basic types of repeal. A repeal with re-[[Wikt:enactment|enactment]] (or [[Wikt:replacement|replacement]]) of the repealed law, or a repeal without replacement. The move to [[Wikt:rescind|rescind]], repeal, or [[Wikt:annul|annul]] is used in parliamentary procedure to cancel or [[Wikt:countermand|countermand]] an action or order previously adopted by the Parliament. Removal of Primary and secondary legislation is normally referred to as [[Wikt:revoke|revocation]] rather than repeal in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Under the common law of England and Wales, the effect of repealing a statute was "to [[Wikt:obliterate|obliterate]] it completely from the Document of Parliament as though it had never been passed." This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the Interpretation Act 1978.
Repertoire	Repertoire (pronounce: "Re-per-twahr") is a French language word used in music and in the theatre. It means a list of pieces of music or Play (theatre). Sometimes the English word repertory is used. When a piano speaks about his or her "repertoire", it means all the pieces that he can play. Most famous musicians have a wide repertoire (they can play a lot of pieces). The "piano repertoire" means all music written for the piano. The violin has a much larger solo repertoire than the viola. That means that much more solo music has been written for the violin than for the viola. A theatre company may have a "repertoire". That means all the plays that they regularly perform. Sometimes theatre companies are called "repertory theatres" because they have a particular list of plays that they perform.
Replacement child	A replacement child is a child Fertilization by parents to replace an older dead sibling. He or she is usually of the same sex as the child they replaced. Often they are given the same name. The replacement child provides consolation to the parents for the loss of the earlier child. It is also frequently believed they are a reincarnation of the lost child.<ref name=Unwert153/> As a result a replacement child represents the hopes and dreams parents had for the dead child.<ref name=Unwert153/>
Rerun	A rerun is a repeat of the same broadcast media, when that program is played again. This is usually a television show, but can also be a radio show.
Residue (chemistry)	In chemistry, residue is what is left behind after preparation, separation, or purification, such as distillation, evaporation, or filtration.
Resilience	Resilience generally means the ability to recover from some shock or disturbance. There are different meanings for
Revenge porn	Revenge pornography is the act of getting revenge toward somebody by way of pornography. This act of revenge is usually done without asking the victim. Revenge porn usually means making sexually explicit videos, books and movies about a person because the person ended a relationship. The possession of the material may be used by the partners to punish the victim for ending a relationship. Several areas have passed laws against revenge porn. They include Israel, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and most of theUnited States. In the 1980s the Hustler magazine began a monthly show of reader-submitted images of naked women called the "Beaver Hunt". The Beaver Hunt photos were usually with details of these women, such as their hobby and their names. Some of the women sued the magazine for publishing their photos without their permission. But it wasn't until 2010 that revenge porn really took off. That year,Hunter Moore launched the website IsAnyoneUp. The website was similar to the Beaver Hunt. The first person who spoke against Moore was activist Charlotte Laws. She was also one of the first people to publicly support revenge pornography victims. In June 2015 Google decided they would remove links to revenge porn on request. Microsoft did the same in July.
Reverse DNS lookup	Reverse DNS lookup (rDNS) is the process of determining the hostname or the Computer associated with a given IP address or any other type of network address. Typically, the Domain Name System is used to determine what IP address is associated with a given domain name. So, to "reverse-resolve" a known IP address to determine the hostname is simply the process of searching what host and domain name belongs to that IP address. A reverse lookup is often referred to as reverse resolving, or more specifically reverse DNS lookup, and is accomplished using a "reverse IN-ADDR entry" in the form of a PTR record. RFC 1033 in the "INSTRUCTIONS" section, and later, RFC 1912 Section 2.1 states "Every Internet-reachable host should have a name" and "Make sure your PTR and A records match".
Rhetoric	Rhetoric is the art of convincing and persuading people by language through public speaking or writing. The root of the word is from Greek language ῥητορικὴ [τέχνη] roughly meaning 'the art of speech'. Webster’s dictionary defines it as “the art or science of using words effectively in speaking or writing, especially the art or science of literary composition.”The word “effectively” in this definition is a relative matter. What is effective in one context may be entirely different in another cultural setting. Different languages differ in their rhetorical styles – that is, in the way that they use language to accomplish various purposes. People can be trained in this skill. It is the art or the technique of persuasion, used by orators (public speakers), writers and media.
Rhizobia	Rhizobia are soil bacterium which become established inside root nodules of legumes (the pea family: Fabaceae). They Nitrogen fixation nitrogen in a form the plant can use. Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. The relationship is a classic example of symbiosis and mutualism. The word rhizobia comes from the English root for root (rhizo) and the Ancient Greek for life (bios).
Rhythm guitar	The term rhythm guitar refers to the style of playing guitar chords, and sometimes playing repeated riffs instead of using the guitar to play melodys or solo (music)s (this kind of playing is called lead guitar). Rhythm guitarists add to the sound of a band, whether they play rock and roll, or other kinds of music. John Lennon of The Beatles usually played rhythm guitar for the band, with George Harrison playing lead guitar. However, Lennon sometimes played keyboard instruments, and once in a while took the lead guitar role, as he did in the songs "You Can't Do That" and "Get Back". Sheet music for rhythm guitar is usually written above the classical notes. It is written in Guitar chord format. [[it:Chitarra#Chitarra ritmica]]
Rhythm section	A rhythm section is the group of musicians in a rock music, jazz, or country music group who play their instruments to set out the pulse or Beat (music) of the music. This is played in Accompaniment (music) to the rest of the band. Some of the rhythm section instruments, such as the guitar and the piano, also play the chord progression (sequence of chords) that a song is based upon. Some rhythm section instruments, such as the drums and percussion, are just used to set out the beat. Most rhythm sections include a bass instrument, such as the bass guitar or the double bass, which plays the deep, low notes of the chord progression.
Riemann sphere	The Riemann sphere is a mathematical model of the extended complex plane. The model is named after Bernhard Riemann. The extended complex plane is the Plane (mathematics) of the complex numbers, plus a point at infinity. With this model, this point at infinity is "close" to very large numbers in the same way zero is "close" to very small ones. The extended complex numbers are useful for Complex analysis: in certain cases, the division by zero is "well-behaved", in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity. With this model, it is possible to change certain functions, so that they become Continuous function, which simplifies calculation. In geometry, the Riemann sphere is a simple example of a Riemann surface. It is also one of the simplest complex manifolds.
Right ascension	Right ascension (abbreviated RA; symbol α) is the astronomy word for one of the two coordinates of a point on the celestial sphere when using the equatorial coordinate system. It is the celestial counterpart to longitude. The other coordinate is the declination. The moon, planets and stars all have their own right ascension. Many of them are listed in an almanac. Using arithmetic, the object’s right ascension and declination indicate where to look in the sky to see the object.
Right to a fair trial	The right to fair trial is an essential Rights in all countries respecting the rule of law. A trial in these countries that is considered unfair will typically be restarted, or its verdict void (law). Some of the rights that make a trial fair are ly proclaimed in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They are clearly stated in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to the United States Constitution. They are also stated in Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the world. There is no binding international law that defines what is or is not a fair trial. Example, the right to a Jury and other important procedures vary from nation to nation.
Rijndael key schedule	Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael) uses a key schedule to expand a short key into a number of separate round keys. This is known as the Rijndael key schedule. The three AES variants have a different number of rounds. Each variant requires a separate 128-bit round key for each round plus one more. The key schedule produces the needed round keys from the initial key.
Ripple (payment protocol)	Ripple is a communication protocol for sending money through the internet. It was developed by Ripple Labs, Inc which is an American Financial technology company. The company wants to take on the established financial industry with their X-rapid blockchain protocol with the XRP settlement token.
Risk and Safety Statements	Risk and Safety Statements are codes that show the hazards of certain chemicals. There are certain R (risk) phrases and S (safety) phrases. For example, R34 states that the chemical may cause burns. S36 says to wear protective clothing.
Rival Lovers	Rival Lovers is a dialogue that was thought to have been written by Plato. In Rival Lovers, Socrates is the Protagonist who asks questions.
Rlogin	In computing, rlogin is a Unix Computer software that allows users to log in on another Server (computing) using a computer network. rlogin uses Internet protocol suite TCP and UDP port 513. It was first distributed as part of the Berkeley Software Distribution release. rlogin is also the name of the application layer Protocol (computing) used by the software, also the protocol is part of the Internet protocol suite. The rlogin homepage is located at http://rlogin.sourceforge.net. rlogin has several serious security problems, the most important are:
Robe	A robe is a type of clothing. It is loose-fitting and sometimes ties in the front.
Robinhood (company)	Robinhood Markets, Inc. is an American financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Robinhood is a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority-regulated broker-dealer. It is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. As of 2020, Robinhood had 13 million users.
Robot lawyer	A robot lawyer is an artificial intelligence (AI) computer program. It is designed to ask the same questions as a real lawyer about certain legal issues. Robot lawyers are being used in many countries around the world including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Holland.
Rock art	Rock art is a term in archaeology for any markings that were made on natural stone by human beings. They can be divided into:
Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin	Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, or Levantine art, is a group of over 750 prehistoric archaeological site. They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998.<ref name=McDonald308/> The sites are in the eastern part of Spain. They show rock art from the Upper Paleolithic or (more likely) Mesolithic periods of the Stone Age. The art is small painted figures of humans and animals. The earliest phases are of animals only.<ref name=Nash24/> They are the most advanced and widespread examples from this period, certainly in Europe. It is notable for the number of places included, the largest concentration of such art in Europe. Its name refers to the Mediterranean Basin. However, while some sites are near the sea, many of them are inland in Aragon and Castile-La Mancha. "Levantine Art" here means "from Eastern Spain", not the Levant region).
Rock flour	Rock flour, or glacial flour, consists of Particle size particles of rock, generated by Glacier#Glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size. Because the material is very small, it is [[:wikt:suspend|suspended]] in river water making the water appear cloudy. If the river flows into a glacial lake, the lake may appear turquoise in color as a result. Examples of this are Lake Louise (Alberta), Canada and Gjende lake in Norway.
Rococo	Rococo is an artistic style which originated in the 18th century in France. Often referred to merely as Late Baroque, the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement. Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style, including elaboration and ornate themes, it was also more playful and asymmetrical. The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV (Louis XIV is associated with the Baroque, whilst Louis XVI with Neoclassicism, albeit his style started off as Rococo at the beginning of reign). Rococo's popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century, fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism. Rococo art and architecture was feminine, graceful, florid and ornate. Creamy and pastel-like colours were used for paintings, unlike the darker shades in Baroque art. Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art, unlike the Baroque, and everyday life became more commonly represented. In such a way, Rococo art revolved around themes such as love, romance, fun, landscapes, and mere portraits. Additionally, Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo, especially Chinoiserie. Famous Rococo artists include Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, amongst several others. The Rococo has been the focus of much discussion, analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history. It has been criticised over the years for being over-the-top, superficial and frivolous; in such a way, the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history. Nevertheless, Rococo art and theatre has also received praise for the elegance, "beauty", and "charm" of its artwork.
Roman law	Roman law is the name used for a system of laws used by the Ancient Rome. It started with the twelve tablets of civil law, . After the law code ordered by it continued as Byzantine law. Roman law is the foundation of most legal systems in Europe, and its former colonies, and it influenced many other countries.
Romanticism	Romanticism (the Romantic era or Romantic period) is a movement, or style of art, literature and music in the late 18th and early 19th century in Europe. The movement said that feelings, imagination, nature, human life, freedom of expression, individualism and old folklore, such as legends and fairy tales, were important.<ref name="Casey"/> It was also a reaction against turning nature into a Natural sciences. The movement showed most strongly in arts like music, and literature. However, it also had an important influence on historiography, education, and natural history.
Root server	A root server is a special server in the DNS that tells a computer what name servers to use for a single top level domain like .com or .net. There are 13 root servers that are in use. They use the letters A through M. A root server is used when a computer tries to look up a domain. For example, if a person types www.google.com into a web browser, their computer will ask their ISP what the IP address for www.google.com is. If the ISP's DNS server does not know (does not have it cached), it will ask a root server which DNS server can tell it the address. The ISP's root server will then get the address from the DNS server that the root server tells it to.
Rorschach test	The Rorschach test is a psychological test in a form of Ink on the cards. It is still used. It was named after Switzerland psychologist Hermann Rorschach.The test determines the state of patients and their problems.
Rose garden	A Rose garden or Rosarium is a garden or park, often open to the [[:wikt:public|public]], in which roses are grown. While some rose gardens have only a decorative purpose, most of them are used to present and grow various types of roses. The first known rose garden was planted by French empress Joséphine de Beauharnais in Malmaison. When she died, in 1814, the garden had around 250 types of garden roses. Another old rose garden is the Rosenhöhe Park in Darmstadt, Germany created in 1810 by Princess Wilhelmine of Baden Growing roses for commercial purposes started in the 19th century. The important rose gardens created for commercial rose breeding were:
Rotary evaporator	A rotary evaporator (or rotavap) is commonly used in chemical laboratories to remove solvents by evaporation. The liquid is put in a round-bottomed flask and placed in the device. The rotavap spins and heats the flask and reduces the pressure inside by creating a vacuum. The vacuum makes the liquid evaporate at a low temperature than normal. The liquid becomes a gas and is collected by cooling it so it condensation into another flask. If there are substances dissolution in the liquid they will be left behind in when it evaporates. If water with salt dissolved in it is evaporated, then pure water and dry salt will be separated. Scientists use rotary evaporators to remove the liquid a solid is dissolved in. Rotary evaporators are often quicker to use than evaporating basins. They can be used for distillations.
Rotation	Rotation is the movement of an object in a circular motion. A two-dimensional object rotates around a center (or point (geometry)) of rotation. A three-dimensional object rotates around a line called an Axis (mathematics). If the axis of rotation is within the body, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin– which implies relative speed and perhaps free-movement with angular momentum. A circular motion about an external point (for example the Earth around the Sun) is called an orbit or more properly orbital revolution.
Rotor (electric)	A rotor is the part of an electric machine (Electric motor or Electrical generator) that Rotation. It rotates because of the torque developed by wires and magnetic field inside the machine.
Rotunda (architecture)	A rotunda (from Latin rotundus) is any building with a circular plan, and sometimes covered by a dome. It may also refer to a round room within a building. A famous example is United States Capitol rotunda below United States Capitol dome of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C..
Round of drinks	A round of drinks is a set of alcoholic beverages bought by one person in a group for the whole group. The buyer buys the round of drinks as a single order at the bar. In many places it is common for people to take turns buying rounds. It is a nearly [[wiktionary:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] custom in Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. In Australia and New Zealand it is called shouting.
Roundup (herbicide)	Roundup is the brand name for a systemic and broad-spectrum glyphosate based herbicide. It is produced under the Bayer company. It was previously produced under Monsanto. Bayer, in 2018, took over Monsanto. Roundup was first developed and patented during the 1970s. It was first marketed to consumers in 1973. As of 2009, sales for Roundup herbicides were still about 10% of Monsanto's revenue. However, China makers of similar herbicides competed with Roundup. The product is marketed to consumers under the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. There is limited evidence saying human cancer risk could increase due to exposure to large amounts of glyphosate. There is almost no good evidence for such a risk though.
Router	A router is a computer whose software and hardware are designed to move data between computer networks. Routers make sure traffic between computers goes where it needs to go. They do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called routing protocols. Routers generally contain a specialized operating system, random access memory, NVRAM, flash memory, and one or more central processing unit, as well as two or more network cards. They come in a variety of sizes from something you could hold in your hand to something too large for one person to lift. If you have an Internet connection, you probably have a router somewhere that your computer sends data to. This is the first router your computer will connect to in order to get to the internet. It is also known as a default gateway (because it is your gateway to the internet). By convention the gateway has the lowest IP address (like a phone number for a computer) in the subnet (a group of addresses). Anytime you make a connection (such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org) your computer looks up the IP address using the look-up service called Domain Name System (Domain Name Service). Once the destination address has been found your computer connects to your gateway router. The gateway then sends data to a router at your Internet service provider (Internet Service Provider), that router can be said to be part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination.In small networks such as homes, small businesses (including internet cafés) and small schools, the router also performs Network address translation (network address translation) which makes all outgoing connections look like they come from one address. Typically, incoming connections are only allowed if they are replies to connections made by a computer inside the NAT. Routers connect two or more networks and direct traffic between them. These networks may be physical (the network is associated with a port) or logical (not associated with a port on the router). The term layer 3 switch often is used the same as 'router', but it is a general term without a technical definition. Layer 3 switch implies a device that is built to connect Ethernet devices in a LAN but can also perform routing. Router operating systems are split into two parts:
Royal Astronomical Society	The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) is a learned society and charitable organisation that supports the study of astronomy, planetary science, geophysics and closely related branches of science. Its headquarters are in Burlington House, on Piccadilly in London. The society has over 4,000 members ("Fellows"), most of them professional researchers or postgraduate students. Around a quarter of Fellows live outside the UK.
Royal Birmingham Society of Artists	The Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (also called RBSA) is a group of artists who have a lot of experience and education. It is located in an area of Birmingham, England called the Jewellery Quarter. The RSBA has an art gallery there. It is a Charitable organization.
Royal Thai General System of Transcription	The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai language words into the Latin script, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other Phonetics features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO basic Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all Document that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show Tone language or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart.
Royal charter	A royal charter is a law document issued by the monarchy which gives certain rights to an organization. When an organization, for example: a university, is founded there has to be an official document which lists the basic laws (the constitution) of the organization. If this document is given to the organization by the king or queen it is called a Royal charter. In Europe Royal charters have been used to create towns ever since the Middle Ages. The date when the charter was made is thought of as the date when the town was founded (started), even if there had been people living there many years before. Many groups such as the British East India Company were formed by Royal charter. Most British university operate under Royal Charters. This gives them the right to give Degree (school) to the students at the end of their studies. The BBC operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a limited period of ten years, after which it is renewed. Charitable organization may also have Royal charters. They do not need to have one, but they are likely to be more successful if they have a Royal charter.
Rule	When something always does the same thing, one can say that there is a rule that it does what it does. The word "rule" has many uses, including the following:
Rule of law	Rule of law is a [[:en:legal maxim|legal maxim]] that suggests that no one is above the law and governmental decisions must be made only by applying known legal and moral principles. The Rule of Law limits the Influence of Government by judicial defense of laws and the Constitution which is based on recognized basic legal values, established in international law. The Rule of Law is meant to prevent dictatorship and to protect the rights of the people. The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. Constitutional economics is the study of government spending, which, in many transitional and developing countries, is completely controlled by the executive. The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in courts in situations of unfair governmental distribution of national money is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law in developing countries. To date, the term “rule of law” has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries. The originally German doctrine of Rechtsstaat is similar, and has been translated into other languages of continental Europe as État de droit (Fr.), Estado de derecho (Sp.), Stato di diritto (It.), and Правовое государство (Ru.). Rechsstaat can be translated into English as “legal state” or "constitutional state". Rule of law is also a main purpose of Council of Europe for solidarity and international peace.
Russian architecture	Russian architecture is the name of the Architecture style of Russia from the early Russian wooden architecture period until the Stalinist Architecture period. from the "Pre-Christian" until the "Kievan Rus Christian" period most of the structures was made of wood and after than the structures was made by stones
Ryanair Flight 4978	Ryanair Flight 4978 was an international scheduled passenger flight from Athens International Airport, Greece, to Vilnius Airport, Lithuania. On 23 May 2021, explosives were falsely reported on board the aircraft as it neared Lithuanian airspace. The aircraft was forced to land by a Belarusian fighter jet when it was over Belarusian airspace. It landed at Minsk National Airport, on the orders of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Once the aircraft was on the ground, two of its passengers, opposition activist and journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested. On August 9, 2021, head of the Minsk National Airport Vyacheslav Khoroneko was put in the of the United States. He got a punishment as a person who made it possible to land the flight there.
SCP Foundation	The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization. It is a collection of the internet-based fiction project of the same name. The SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, aliens, locations, and objects that violate natural law. The SCP Foundation have created games and writings that were horror fiction, science fiction, and urban fantasy. Many well known horror Indie game inspired by SCP are SCP – Containment Breach and [[SCP:Secret Laboratory]].
SHA hash functions	In cryptography, the Secure Hashing Algorithms are a group of cryptographic hash functions released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The algorithms take an input and produce a hash value (often shown in hexadecimal). The length of the hash depends on the digest length of the algorithm.
SOCKS	SOCKS is an Internet protocol that allows one client computer to connect to another computer via a third computer (SOCKS server). SOCKS is an abbreviation for "SOCKetS". When a direct connection between two computers (clients) is not possible for some services (e.g. HTTP, FTP, or chat protocols like MSN and AOL), a user can use these services via a so-called SOCKS server (routing). Example: Bill wants to chat with Jane. Bill has a bad service provider who limits internet access. Bill's computer then connects to the SOCKS server, which is able to "chat" with Jane's computer without restrictions. An HTTP proxy works similar to a SOCKS server, but is limited on routing HTTP traffic only.
SP-network	In cryptography, an SP-network, or substitution–permutation network (SPN), is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES (Rijndael), 3-Way, Kalyna, Kuznyechik, PRESENT, SAFER, SHARK, and Square. Such a network takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating "rounds" or "layers" of substitution boxes (S-boxes) and permutation boxes (P-boxes) to produce the ciphertext block. The S-boxes and P-boxes transform (sub-)blocks of input bits into output bits. It is common for these transformations to be operations that are efficient to perform in hardware, such as exclusive or (XOR) and bitwise rotation. The key is introduced in each round, usually in the form of "round keys" derived from it. (In some designs, the S-boxes themselves depend on the key.) Decryption is done by simply reversing the process (using the inverses of the S-boxes and P-boxes and applying the round keys in reversed order). An S-box substitutes a small block of bits (the input of the S-box) by another block of bits (the output of the S-box). This substitution should be one-to-one, to ensure invertibility (hence decryption). In particular, the length of the output should be the same as the length of the input (the picture on the right has S-boxes with 4 input and 4 output bits), which is different from S-boxes in general that could also change the length, as in DES (Data Encryption Standard), for example. An S-box is usually not simply a permutation of the bits. Rather, a good S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits (or an avalanche effect). It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit. A P-box is a permutation of all the bits: it takes the outputs of all the S-boxes of one round, permutes the bits, and feeds them into the S-boxes of the next round. A good P-box has the property that the output bits of any S-box are distributed to as many S-box inputs as possible. At each round, the round key (obtained from the key with some simple operations, for instance, using S-boxes and P-boxes) is combined using some group operation, typically XOR. A single typical S-box or a single P-box alone does not have much cryptographic strength: an S-box could be thought of as a substitution cipher, while a P-box could be thought of as a transposition cipher. However, a well-designed SP network with several alternating rounds of S- and P-boxes already satisfies Shannon's confusion and diffusion properties:
SSH file transfer protocol	In computing, the SSH File Transfer Protocol (sometimes called Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP) is a network Protocol (computing) that implements computer file between computers. It is often used as more secure alternative of an FTP protocol, which transmits file contents, folder contents and even passwords without encryption. SFTP protocol is built on top of SSH protocol which is used as a transport layer over the port 22 and is implemented by an SSH server such as OpenSSH.SFTP is different from Secure copy, which is another protocol relying on an SSH connection. It is also different from FTPS, which used SSL to encrypt the connection itself, rather than sending the data through an SSH tunnel. Many popular FTP programs have added support for SFTP. Access to the SFTP server can be granted either through a username, a password or by using a public key.
Saab	Saab is a Sweden car and airplane maker, started in Trollhattan, Sweden in 1937. Saab started to make cars in 1947. The automobile part of the business is now owned by Spyker Cars. The aviation and military parts of Saab are owned by the Wallenberg family.
Sabena Flight Academy	CAE Global Academy Brussels Sabena Flight Academy is a Belgium flight school created in 1953. It is in Steenokkerzeel (Brussels Airport). The school trains airline pilot and is part of CAE Global Academy.
Sacred architecture	Sacred architecture (also known as religious architecture) is concerned with the design and construction of worship and buildings such as Church (building), Mosque#Architecture, stupas, synagogue, and temples.
Sage	The sage (also called wise old man or "Senex") is a character who often appears in literature and mythology. He is an old man who is very wise. In times of trouble people go to ask the sage for advice. The sage is a very calm, intelligent old man. He is like a father-figure or grandfather-figure. He gives sensible advice or judgment. In some stories the sage is seen as"foreign" in some way, that is, he is different from the other people of that culture. Merlin is a good example of this, as he was only half human. The psychologist Carl Jung called him a senex. This is Latin for old man. Jung sees him as someone who realizes that the young person is going to be the hero of the story, and he himself is just an advisor.
Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search	The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or SWEEPS, was an astronomical survey. It was carried out in 2006. SWEEPS used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at 180,000 stars for seven days to find extrasolar planets.<ref name="SIMBAD"></ref>
Salon (meeting)	A salon is a gathering of people held by an inspiration host. During the gathering there is amusement and the people increase their knowledge through conversation.
Salwar kameez	Salwar kameez (also spelled shalwar kameez or shalwar qameez) is a traditional dress worn by both women and men in Southern Asia. Salvars or shalvars are loose pajamas-like trousers. The legs are wide at the top, and narrow at the bottom. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic. The side seams (known as the chaak) are left open below the waist-line, which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement. It is the most common dress for men in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Sam Hill (euphemism)	Sam Hill is an American English slang phrase, a euphemism for "the devil" or "hell" personified (as in, "What in the Sam Hill is that?").
Sami literature	Sami literature has been written at least since 1673. Prose (in Sami language) has been written since 1910.<ref name=SamiLiteratureSNL/>
Samizdat	Samizdat was the underground literature of the Soviet Union. Since many authors were banned, and could not publish their works, people used typescripts to circulate their work. Penalties for being caught with copies of banned works was severe. Owning a printing press required permission, and all forms of printing required a licence. However, typewriters were common and, with the aid of carbon paper, many copies of the best works were produced and circulated. Once samizdats were in circulation, they sometimes got into the West. Several important works were published from samizdat and translated, before they were published in the Soviet Union.
Sanctuary city	A sanctuary city is a municipal area that limits cooperation with the government's effort to enforce immigration law. They are mainly in Western Europe, the United States and Canada. Leaders of sanctuary cities say they wish to cut down fear of deportation and possible family breakups with people who are in a country illegally. That's so that such people may be willing to report a crime and send their children to school. Some states, such as Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Georgia (U.S. state), Missouri and Florida do not allow sanctuary cities. Others, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois New York, Colorado and California allow sanctuary cities. In early 2018, a Chicago federal judge said that the Donald Trump administration could not withhold public safety grants to sancutary cities. Those decisions were seen as a setback to the Trump administration efforts for helping authorities police illegal immigration.
Sand castle	Sand castles are castles made of sand and water. People have taken making sand castles and turned it into an type of art called sand sculpture. Sand castles are often made on a sandy beach or in a sandpit.
Santos-Dumont 14-bis	The Santos-Dumont 14-bis was a biplane invented in the early 1900s by Alberto Santos-Dumont. In the fall of 1906, it became the first airplane to fly in Europe. Santos-Dumont tried several times before he truly managed to fly in the 14-bis. His first attempt in July 1906 did not work. In September, he managed two short hops. In October, the 14-bis flew for 50 meters. That was the first flight that the Aero Club of France ever officially witnessed. According to the Aero Club of France, the 14-bis was 40 feet wide from wingtip to wingtip, 33 feet wide, and weighed 352 pounds. It used an Antoinette engine. The 14-bis had three different sets of controls so Alberto Santos-Dumont could steer. Some were tied to his shoulders so that he looked like he was dancing or shaking while in the air.<ref name="AirSpace" /> No one knows where the original 14-bis from the fall of 1906 is now. Experts think Santos-Dumont took it apart and used the pieces to build other airplanes. Some people, especially in Brazil, believe the 14-bis was the first airplane to fly, before the Wright Brothers' Flyer. The main reason for this is that although the Wright Brothers flew the Flyer at Kitty Hawk in 1903, they did not tell many people about it right away. Europeans saw Alberto Santos-Dumont fly the 14-bis in 1906 before they heard about the Wrights flying the Flyer in 1903. This was because the Wright Brothers hoped to patent their work and make money, so they kept most of their experiments a secret. Alberto Santos Dumont was not trying to make money, so he invited almost anyone who wanted to come watch him work. However, the Wright Brothers did invite witnesses to their first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 to watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers.<ref name="CNN" /> Today, most aviation historians believe that the 14-bis was not the first plane to fly.
Sari (clothing)	A sari (also known as a saree or a shari) is a type of clothing for women. It is mostly used as a daily clothing in modern Republic of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka as well as formal clothing in Pakistan. It is a very long strip of cloth. Women wrap it around their body. It is the National dress-code commonly worn by Bangladeshi and Indian women alike respectively. Also some Urdu or Mohajir-speaking communities of Pakistani women also wear this garment. There are different kinds of saris for different occasions.
Saturation (chemistry)	The term saturation in chemistry is used in several ways:
Saturn Award	The Saturn Award is an award presented every year by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films to honor the top works in science fiction, fantasy, and Horror fiction in movie, television, and home video. The prestigious Saturn Awards were devised by Dr. Donald A. Reed, who felt that movies within those genres were never given the appreciation they deserved. The physical award is a representation of the planet Saturn (planet), surrounded with a ring of photographic film. The award was initially, and is still sometimes loosely referred to as a Golden Scroll. Similar to other awards, like the Academy Award, the Emmy Award and the Grammy Award, the Saturn are voted on by members of the presenting Academy. There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in the field. The awards were first presented in 1972.
Scalable Hosting	Scalable Hosting or "Scalacube" develops hosting services that include a Control panel (web hosting), allowing users to create their game servers for Minecraft, Rust, [[Ark:Survival Evolved|ARK]], Hytale, etc. According to their website, they combines Virtual private server and game server hosting. The company was founded in January 2019 by Kostiantyn Rohatkin and is headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia. In October 2020, the business was accredited by the Estonian Startup Committee.
Scale model	A scale model is a copy of an object that is bigger or smaller than the real size of the object. Very often the scale model is smaller than the real object and used as a guide to making the object in full size. Scale models are made or for many reasons. You can also use it with math.
Scarecrow	A scarecrow is a figure usually made of sticks. It looks like a person. It is dressed in old clothes. A farmer puts a scarecrow in a field after he has planted seeds. He hopes the scarecrow will frighten birds away from the field. Some birds such as crows and sparrows eat the seeds the farmer plants. He does not want the birds to do this. If the birds eat the seeds, the farmer will not have a big crop of things to eat.
Schopenhauer Society	The Schopenhauer Society is a German literary and philosophy society. It is a community that studies the writings, the life, and the influence of the German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer. The society was formed in 1911 in Frankfurt by Paul Deussen, a Sanskrit scholar. Well-known members were Arthur Hübscher and Alfred Schmidt.
Sclerophyll	Sclerophyll is a type of vegetation which has hard leaf and short internodes (the distance between leaves along the stem). The word comes from the Greek sclero (hard) and phyllon (leaf). Sclerophyllous plants occur in many parts of the world. They are shaped by a Mediterranean climate, with mild, wet winters and long hot dry summers. Wildfires often occur. These conditions feature summer drought-tolerant plants with hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves, This kind of climate occurs in:
Scots law	Scots law is the system of laws used in Scotland, a home nation of the United Kingdom. Scots law is a mixture of a common law system and a civil law system. Scotland has its own judiciary and its own courts. Scotland kept Scots law from the old Kingdom of Scotland after the Acts of Union 1707 formed the British state. Scots law is different from English law because the two kingdoms of Great Britain in the High Middle Ages and after, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England each had its own system of laws. The Scots jurisdiction kept its own legal system, and Scots law and Scots courts are independent of English law. After the personal union of Scotland with England and Ireland under their common king, James VI and I, Scotland kept Scots law and England kept English law. After the unification of the Parliament of Scotland with the Parliament of England by the Acts of Union 1707, the new Parliament of Great Britain in London's Palace of Westminster got the power to make Scots laws. The Parliament of Scotland, the old legislature, came to an end. Scots laws started again to be made in Scotland when the new Scottish Parliament came into being as a result of devolution in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Both the British and Scottish parliaments now make Scots law. These two legislatures are sometimes called "Westminster" and "Holyrood", named after the areas of the Capital city in which they meet.
Scriptio continua	Scriptio continua (Latin for "continuous script") is a style of writing that does not use spaces, different letter cases, or punctuation to tell apart words, phrases, or sentences. It was a common way of writing for texts in Ancient Greek language and Classical Latin. Even though Greek and Latin speakers already created punctuation to tell words apart, scriptio continua was often used to save space. This was because writing materials were expensive and the boundaries between words, clauses, and sentences are not so clear in spoken language. Use of scriptio continua became less common after the fall of the Roman Empire, and spaces began to appear between words. The first known documents that used spacing were Irish language and Old English Bibles and Gospels. However, scriptio continua is still used for the writing systems for several modern languages, including Southeast Asian abugidas like Thai language, Lao language, Khmer language, Burmese language, Javanese language, Balinese, and Tibetan language. Languages that use the Chinese character system like Chinese language and Japanese language sometimes use scriptio continua, even though modern Chinese and Japanese stopped using it when they adopted punctuation during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Sea grass	Sea grasses are flowering plants which live in the sea. They come from one of four plant families in the order Alismatales. They are monocotyledons which grow in Marine biology, fully Salinity environments. Sea grass (seagrass) is a key part of continental shelf ecosystems where phytoplankton produce carbonate sediment. This kind of ecosystem occurs in subtropical places like Florida Bay, and around Bermuda. Sea grass beds often contain many species from various phyla. Apparently, seagrass Herbivore is a highly important link in the food chain. Many species feed on sea grasses, such as green turtles, dugongs, manatees, fish, geese, swans, sea urchins and crabs. The surface of the seagrass is the place where Melobesia, a small alga, makes chalk as a by-product of its metabolism. That is not the only chalk-producing organism in the seagrass beds.
Search engine optimization	Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making websites appear as a top result when someone searches for a specific term. The search term is called a Keyword. The results of the search are displayed in search engine's results pages (SERPS) such as those given by Google. A more common word used to describe search engine optimization is internet marketing or search engine marketing.<ref name=":0" />
Second Alcibiades	Second Alcibiades (also called Alcibiades II or Alcibiades minor) is a text in Ancient Greek language. It is a dialogue. Originally, it was attributed to Plato, but today it is thought Plato was not the author. In the dialogue, Socrates talks to the young Alcibiades. Alcibiades later became a successful statesman and general. The two people talk about Philosophy aspects of prayer. The starting point of the question is how prayer should be performed correctly, and what to pray for.
Second language	A second language is a language that a person learns in addition to their mother tongue. A second language may be learned in a formal or informal way, such as at school or in a family. A person may speak two or more second languages. Adults do not learn languages the same way that children do. Learning a second language is difficult for adults, who rarely speak it as well as their native language because it is much easier for children to learn a second language. Some children have native multilingualism and so speak several languages, such as by living in a foreign country or having a father speaking a different language from their mother.
Second moment of area	The moment of Force (physics) (also called the first moment of force) about any point is the product of the force and perpendicular distance between them. If this first moment is again multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them, the product so obtained is called the second moment of force or moment of moment of the force. If instead of force, the area of the figure or mass of the body is considered, it is called the second moment of area or second moment of mass. They are also termed broadly as moments of inerta. There is no physical significance for moment of inertia. It is just a mathematical expression usually denoted by I
Secret sharing	Secret sharing is used as a term to refer to ways of sharing a secret among many people. Each person knows part of the secret that is shared, but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret. The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret. Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other, in 1979. One example where secret sharing is used is the RSA. It uses a secret key. If this key is distributed among many people, no single person can make a signature. Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost, a number of them can still make a signature. This is often used is areas where security is very important, such as banks, or the military. The dealer hands each player their part of the secret. In an easier setup, the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret, but with each part there is extra information. Say that a secret needs five parts, and three parts are known. In this setup, guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known. The other setup is said to be Information theoretic security from the point of view of information theory, because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret. There are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques.
Section sign	The section sign (§) (also known as a section mark, section symbol, double s or paragraph mark in parts in Europe) is a character used in legal code, and is a punctuation mark.This character is used to refer to a section in legal code. For example, in the APA style: "Title 16 of the United States Code Section 580p" becomes "16 US Code § 580p", which shows the section sign in place of "United States Code Section".
Secure channel	In cryptography, a secure channel is a way of Transmitter data that is very difficult (called resistant) to overhear or copy (called interception) and understand (called decrypt) or change (called tampering). A confidential channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to interception, but may not be resistant to tampering and may not be resistant to impersonation by someone else (called spoofing). An authenticatable channel is a way of transferring data that is resistant to spoofing but may not be resistant to interception or tampering.
Security interest	A security interest is a legal on collateral (finance). The collateral can be real estate, personal property or any asset. Collateral is usually used to secure a loan. The er is the party who borrows the funds. The er is the one who lends the money in return for a security interest. The lender can Repossession the asset if the borrower fails to repay the loan. The lender can then sell the asset to repay the loan.<ref name=IP/> A loan secured by collateral is called a secured loan (also called a lien). A loan with no collateral (such as a credit card) is an unsecured loan. There is nothing for the lender to repossess.
Selective Service System	The Selective Service System is an independent agency of the United States government. It has information on those subject to the U.S. military draft. All male citizenship in the United States and male immigrant non-citizens between ages 18 and 25 are required by law to register within 30 days of their 18th birthdays. They must also contact the Selective Service within ten days of any changes of any information they gave, like a change of address. Females, on the other hand, are not required to register. Registration with Selective Service is also required for several federal programs and benefits, including job training, federal employment, naturalization, Pell grants and student loans. On July 2, 1980, then-President of the United States Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4771 (Registration under the Military Selective Service Act). That was in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan 1979. It re-established the Selective Service registration requirement for all 18-to-26 year old men born on or after January 1, 1960. The first registrations began on July 21, 1980 at various post offices across the United States, starting with men born in 1960. Men born in or after 1963 were required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday. On April 27, 2016, the Armed House Services Committee voted to add an amendment to extend the authority for draft registration to females. If the bill had passed, it would have authorized then-President Barack Obama to order young women as well as men to register with the Selective System.
Selectivity (electronic)	The principle of Selectivity (Discrimination) is based upon an analysis of several circuit breaker characteristics. These include time-current (tripping) curves, peak-let-through-current (Ipeak) and energy let-through (I²T). The maximum selectivity level with two nominated breakers in series under short-circuit conditions is often stated by vendors in Technical Reference manuals. Selectivity can be enhanced beyond the breaking capacity of the downstream breaker provided it is backed up by an appropriately selected upstream breaker, which should not trip (unlatch) under the stated short circuit current. Selectivity works as the upstream breaker heats up under fault conditions providing impedance in the fault circuit reducing the overall fault severity.
Self-denial	Self-denial or self sacrifice, is denial or sacrifice of one's needs and desires.
Self-disorder	A self-disorder is also called an ipseity disturbance. It is a bad change in the minimal self of the person. The minimal self is like a solid center that someone experiences reality with. It can be disturbed in schizophrenia and similar disorders. The self-disorder can show itself in different ways.
Self-esteem	Self-esteem is the way people think about themselves and how worthwhile they feel. Psychologists use the word self-esteem to describe whether someone likes them self or not. Someone with high self-esteem might think that they are good at things and are worthwhile and they are confident in the things that they do. Someone with low self-esteem might think that they are bad at things and worthless. Different psychologists have different ways of measuring self-esteem, and many people do not agree with what it means. Some people think that self-esteem is linked to depression (illness), eating disorders and bullying. Some people may also Self-injury if they suffer from a low self-esteem. Self-esteem also considered by the international law on human rights, such as Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Yogyakarta Principles, and they affirm that each person's self-esteem must be protected against any kind of abuse or violence out of social prejudices and discriminations. World Health Organization also think that to make strong self-esteem is important to suicide prevention of students as well as prevent bullying by tolerance.
Self-injury	Self-injury (SI) or self-harm (SH) occurs when a person hurts their body on purpose. This kind of harm is not suicide behavior. Many self-harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive. However, in some cases the self-harm becomes so bad it can lead to death, and those who self-harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not. There are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves, though it is often hard to find an exact cause. Sometimes, the self-harm helps relieve unbearable emotions, or feelings of unreality or Anhedonia. Self-harm is often a symptom of other problems. These problems may include physical abuse, sexual abuse, or eating disorders. Self-harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism. Studying the causes of self-injury can be difficult or inaccurate, because many self-harmers try to hide their injuries.
Self-portrait	A Self portrait is a picture of the artist drawing it. The earliest example of a self-portrait made was Jan van Eyck in 1433. The most famous self portrait painter was Vincent van Gogh. He painted a picture of himself 37 times from 1886 to 1889.
Semantic Web	The Semantic Web is a project of the World Wide Web Consortium that uses metadata, to write specific details related to a subject, to let computers better process the information on the internet. This plan, for saving additional semantic details, would make computers able to do more of the work involved in finding, sharing and combining information on the internet. The Semantic Web is an idea of the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners Lee. He has wanted to make the web more intuition about how to meet a user's needs. The semantics of information and services is definition in Web Ontology Language (OWL) and RDF Schemas. These are used to give a formal description of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given area of knowledge. Tim Berners-Lee's idea was as follows:
Semi-aquatic	Semi-aquatic animals spend part of their life on land, and part in the water. Such animals include:
Semiotics	Semiotics (or semiology) is a theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language, signs and symbols. It was first developed in the early 20th century, separately, by the Swiss Ferdinand Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce of the U.S.A. It can be described as both a science and a Skill: a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the Sensory system, Visual system, Auditory system, tactile, Olfaction, or Gustatory system.
Semisolid	A semisolid is a substance that is in between a solid and a liquid. Another name for a semi-solid is a quasi-solid. Mayonnaise is an example of a semi-solid. Mayonnaise does not hold its shape like a solid but does not flow like a liquid. A substance like gel or cream is another example of a semi-solid. Normally semi-solids are covalent bond things. Covalent substances get softer and softer until they melt. Ionic bond substances melt at one temperature and do not get softer. Butter can be a semisolid when it is warm. Butter does not hold its shape but it does not flow like a liquid. Paint is also a semisolid, since it is highly viscous.
Semivowel	Semivowels are Consonant that almost sound like Vowel. In English language, the semivowels are written as W and Y (written as /w/ and /j/ in International Phonetic Alphabet). In Latin, even though semivowels are Phoneme, or unique sounds, they have no special letters used to write them. The letters V and I were used to write the sounds /w/ and /j/, and these same letters were also used to write the vowels /u/ and /i/ in the same order. For example, Gaius Julius Caesar was written as Gaivs Ivlivs Caesar and wine was written as vinvm. The letter J was added after the Decline of the Roman Empire to write the semivowel /j/ to show the difference between /j/ and /i/.
Sensation	A sensation is something that produces excitement. A new song or a new play might be termed a "sensation" or producing "sensation". A thrilling ride on a roller coaster might be described as "sensational".
Separately managed account	A Separately Managed Account or SMA is a type of financial investment account popular with some individual investors. SMAs are offered by financial consultants and brokerage firms, and managed by independent "money managers." A money manager is simply a business that manages stock and other securities portfolios or baskets of investments for an investor. SMAs have varying fee structures. Common characteristics of SMA programs are: they provide open investment choices; have multiple managers; and, offer a customized investment portfolio created for a client's specific needs. By customizing the portfolio, investors can limit the investment risk with various strategies, such as using stock options, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Separation process	A separation process is a method used in science to separate two substances, that once formed a mixture. The type of separation process used depend on the mixture's properties and components. Here are examples of separation techniques: distillation, evaporation, chromatography, filtration, fractional distillation and magnetism. The end product of the separation process is one or more pure compounds .
Seriatim	In law, seriatim (Latin for "in series") indicates that a court is addressing multiple issues in a certain order, such as the order that the issues were originally presented to the court.
Sericulture	Sericulture, also called silk farming, is the process of making silk fibers. It starts by raising silkworms and then processing the fibers they produce. Silk fibers are combined into silk thread. The thread can then be twisted into silk yarn or weaving into silk cloth (fabric).
Series and parallel circuits	Two types of electrical circuits are the series circuit, and the parallel circuit.
Serpent (cipher)	Serpent is a Symmetric-key algorithm block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard Competition after Rijndael key schedule. Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen. Serpent has a block size (cryptography) of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits. The cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words. Each round applies one of eight 4-bit by 4-bit Substitution box 32 times in parallel. Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel computing, using 32 1-bit slices. This maximizes parallelism, but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on Data Encryption Standard. Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin: the designers Estimation 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack, but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future in cryptanalysis. The Serpent cipher has not been patented. It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone.
Server	In net jargon, a server is a computer that serves many kinds of information to a [[:wikt:user|user]] or client machine. Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between client and server is called a client-server relationship. For example, Wikipedia has Website servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host Video game, File server, and give access to peripheral equipment such as printers. In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. With an Internet connection, different users anywhere in the world can access these files. For servers and clients to talk to each other, they need to be connected to a computer network. They need to use the same communication protocol, a set way for machines to talk to other machines. It is like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP to send web sites to your computer, and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages.
Server log	A server log records what is happening on a server at any time. For example, an HTTP server runs a web site. [[de:Logdatei]]
Sexual abuse	Sexual abuse (also called sexual molestation) is when one person forces another person to unwillingly commit any sexual act, Sexual harassment or any sexual assault. A person who commits sexual abuse is called a molester, abuser, or sexual abuser. When a victim of sexual abuse is under the age of consent, it is known as child sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can lead to many psychological problems, including low self-esteem, clinical depression, and other mental disorders, especially if the victim is a child and/or the abuse is severe. Some groups of people are more likely to be sexually abused than others. It is common knowledge that girls and women are sexually abused more often than boys and men, and that abusers are usually men. Disabled people, especially disabled girls, are much more likely than non-disabled people to be sexually abused. They are often abused by authority figures in their lives, such as carers. Disabled people are more vulnerable to sexual assault for a number of reasons. People of different races have different rates of being sexually abused. African Americans girls and women 12 years old and older experience higher rates of sexual abuse.
Shape of the universe	The shape of the Universe cannot be discussed with everyday terms, because all the terms need to be those of Einsteinian relativity. The geometry of the universe is therefore not the ordinary Euclidean geometry of our everyday lives. According to the special theory of relativity, it is impossible to say whether two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space. To speak of "the shape of the universe (at a point in time)" is naive from the point of view of special relativity. Due to the relativity of we cannot speak of different points in space as being "at the same point in time" nor, therefore, of "the shape of the universe at a point in time". What Astrophysics do is ask whether a particular model of the universe is consistent with what is known through observations and measurements of the universe. If the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe (in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller or even infinitesimal), observation is limited to a part of the whole. Consideration of the shape of the universe can be split into two:
Share (finance)	In finance, a share is a unit of account for many different financial things including stocks, mutual funds, limited partnerships, and Real estate investment trust's. In British English, the word share alone to talk only about stocks is so common that it almost replaces the word stock itself.
Sharecropping	Sharecropping is a term for when one person farms another person's land, and then the two share what is produced. Sharecroppers are almost always poor, and are often in debt to landowners or other people. Sharecropping was very common in the Southern United States after the Civil War and the end of slavery. At that time, many African-Americans sharecropped on the land that they had once farmed as slaves. Sharecropping was part of the system of "Jim Crow laws", which kept blacks poor and not really citizens. Sharecropping became more common in the Southern United States when slavery was abolished. During the 20th century it became rare there.
Shared secret	In cryptography, a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication. The shared secret can be a password, a passphrase, a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes. The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate; in this case it can also be called a pre-shared key. Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol, for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange or using symmetric-key algorithm such as Kerberos (protocol). The shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging in to a remote system) using methods such as Challenge-response authentication or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more key (cryptography) to use for encryption and/or Message authentication code of messages. To make unique Session key the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector (IV). An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method.
Shareholder	A shareholder is a person that has investment their own money in a particular company. This means they have partial ownership of the company. Shareholders can vote for board of directors who are responsible for company's corporate governance.
Shareware	Shareware is a way to sell software. The user will get a preview or demo (version) of the software for Free software. This way, the user can decide if he or she likes the computer program or not before buying the complete program. Users can get games for free this way but most of the time these games do not have all the levels. Sometimes Internet Relay Chat clients let users have a demo of their client for 30 days, but after that, in order to keep using it, the user will have to pay money.
Shchusev State Museum of Architecture	The Shchusev State Museum of Architecture is a museum in Moscow, Russia. The museum is dedicated to architecture and urban planning in Russia. It is the largest architecture museum in Russia. It includes an archive, library, and study center. The museum was opened in 1934. It is named for Soviet architect Alexey Shchusev.
Sheet music	Sheet music is a type of printed music. The music that musician have in front of them when they play is printed music. The sheet or sheets of paper that contain(s) the written notation of what the musician are to play is called printed music. Sheet music usually refers to a "single sheet" of music; that is, one song or piece printed separately. Printed music includes sheet music but also includes music published in collections. People often confuse sheet music with printed music. Sheet music can be published as a separate copy for one composition (music) or song, or it can be a collection of pieces in a larger book. If there is a piece of music for violin and piano, then the pianist will play from the piano part, which will have the piano music written, as usual, on two stave (music). Above those two staves, printed slightly smaller, will be another stave with the violin part. The violinist will play from a separate part which will just have the violin music. This means that the pianist can always see what the violin should be playing, but the violinist will not be able to see what the pianist is playing. The violinist may need to look at the piano part sometimes to see how the violin and piano part fit together. It would be difficult for the violinist to play from music with both parts because he would need to turn the pages too often. (Unless the violinist had a few measures of rest right before the page turn, the violinist would miss playing some of his/her part while turning the page.)
Shifting cultivation	Shifting cultivation is an Agriculture system in which areas of land are for a short time.Shifting cultivation is practised in the thickly forested areas of Amazon basin,tropical Africa,parts of southeast Asia and northeast India. These are areas of heavy rainfall and quick regenerating of vegetation. Then they are left to grow back their natural vegetation, while the farmer moves to another area. It is practised in forested areas of the Amazon basin.It is one of the rudimentary forms of cultivation.After cultivation a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them.The ashes are then mixed with the soil and crops like maize,yam,potatoes and cassava are grown. After the soil looses its fertility, the land is abandoned and the cultivator moves to a new plot.Because the soil is no longer protected from the large trees in the rainforest system, it can be ruined easily by thick rain and too much sun.One of the main problems with shifting cultivation is that the land is ruined after being used 3 to 4 times, which means that the areas of land are abandoned and not prepared to grow again- and the rainforest becomes smaller with each preparation for a new piece of land.Shifting cultivation is also known as slash and burn agriculture.
Shill	A shill is a 'plant' or stooge. They are people, usually paid, who promote something while pretending to be independent. Shills publicly help or give credibility to a person or organization with which they have a private relationship. Shills operate in media, journalism, marketing, confidence trick, or other business areas. A shill may also discredit opponents or critics of their client by character assassination or other means. Usually, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, or marks, the impression of an enthusiastic customer. They pretend independence of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. The shill works for the man who does the tricks to extract money from the onlookers. The arena can be as basic as a street three-shell game, or as complex as a massive stock exchange fraud. All it takes is someone who looks like a fellow player to show big appreciation of the seller's product. The shill and his client ("the man") rely on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting. With a big audience, such as a magician's show or a political rally, there are placed people in the audience very often. Then the shill is called a plant or stooge. What the shill does is similar or identical to what advertising and public relations do. However, it is more obvious that the latter have a vested interest because everyone knows they are being paid for their work. Another place for shilling is the many web auctions.
Shit happens	Shit happens is a common vulgar slang phrase. It is used as a simple existentialism observation that life has many unpredictable events, either "Así es la vida" or "List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#C.27est la vie". The phrase accepts that bad things happen to people for no reason. The phrase was first found in 1964, but wasn't used in a print publication until 1983. "Stuff happens" is also said.
Short (finance)	To short an asset means to bet that the asset will lose value, or that the current price is overvalued (higher than its supposed value). If the asset in question does indeed lose value, the person who shorted it will win the bet, and make a profit.This can be done by borrowing assets and selling them at a higher price, returning the asset once you can buy it back at a lower price. For example, if you think that Tesla Motors Stock will lose 10% of the value, you could short the stock, and make a 10% profit once it goes down by 10%. However, if Tesla stock gains value, than you will lose the equivalent amount.
Short circuit	A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch. A short circuit can result in a very high Electric current flowing through the circuit. The high current can destroy components, melt Insulator (electricity) and start a fire. If there is enough voltage, it can also cause an explosion called arc flash. Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and (usually) shut the power off before any damage can be done. A "short circuit" also happens when there is a bypass of electrical current. As electricity is "lazy", when there is a bypass without a "load" (e.g. Bulb), it will travel that route of least electrical impedance. The term "short circuit" is frequently misused to describe any electrical problem.
Side	In geometry, a side is a line that is part of a flat shape made from straight lines. It is also a face in a solid three-dimensional object. The number of sides in a polygon is often written as n, while the number of faces in a polyhedron is often written as F. As an example, the square (geometry) on the right has four sides. The sides in this picture are made with black straight lines. The four sides are:
Sight	Sight (also called eyesight or vision) is one of the Sensory system. Having sight means to be able to see. Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world. Some simple animals can only tell light from dark, but with vertebrates, the visual system is able to form images. The ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes is called visual perception. Sight is the resulting perception. The components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system.
Silhouette	A silhouette is an image in outline only, usually filled in as black on a white background. The inside of a silhouette is featureless.It differs from an outline. That shows the edge of an object in line form, but a silhouette is a solid shape. Silhouette images may be made in any visual artistic medium. The word was first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed. Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century. They were a cheap alternative to the portrait miniature. Skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait in a matter of minutes. Other artists, especially about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could also be done quickly. From its original graphic meaning, the term silhouette has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is Backlighting (lighting design), and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as "in silhouette".
Silliness	Silliness is when a person acts like a , or shows a lack of good or judgment. In television, movies, and the circus, silliness such as , Comedy behavior is used to make audiences laugh. Clowns and jesters act in a silly way to make people feel better.
Similarity (geometry)	Similarity is an idea in geometry. It means that two Polygon, Line segment, or other figures can become the same via resizing. Similar objects do not need to have the same size. Two shapes are similar if their angles have the same measure and their sides are Proportionality. Two Circle, Square, or line segments are always similar. If figure F is similar to figure F', then we write F \sim F'. When it comes to similarity, Triangle are special. This is because triangles can be similar if only their Angle are equal, or only their sides are proportional. All other polygons must meet both of the conditions. Similarity is very similar to congruence. Congruent shapes have the same sides and angles. Because of that, two shapes are congruent to each other if one can become another through Rotation, reflecting or moving only.<ref name=":0" /> In fact, all shapes that are congruent to each other are also similar, but not vice versa.
Simply connected space	A space (or shape) is called simply connected if it is all one piece and does not have any "holes" that pass all the way through it. For example, a ball is simply connected, but a doughnut is not. More formally, being "one piece" means a shape is path-connected, which means there is a path from any point inside the shape to any other which does not leave the shape.
Sirach	Sirach, by Ben Sira, which is also known as Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach, the Wisdom of Ben Sira, or Ecclesiasticus, is a work from the early second century BC, its original version being written in Hebrew language. It is part of the Apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.
Site of Special Scientific Interest	A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a type of legal conservation given to an area in the United Kingdom. They are sites of biological or geological interest, or both. Any activity which might affect an SSSI is Law unless the appropriate planning body gives permission. Owners of land must do what needs to be done to Protected area an SSSI which sits on their land. There may be grants available to help Ownership look after the site.
SketchUp	SketchUp is a 3D modelling computer program made for architects, engineers, and moviemakers. It is easier to use than most programs used for three dimensional drawings. SketchUp was created by the company @Last Software and released in August 2000. In 2006, @Last Software was bought by Google. They released SketchUp6 in January 2007. SketchUp6 can use add-ons that let things build with the program be made into files that can be used with Google Earth. In 2012, SketchUp was bought by Trimble Navigation.
Skew lines	Skew lines are straight lines that are neither parallel (geometry) nor intersecting. Skew lines cannot be in the same Plane (mathematics). This means they exist only in at least three-dimensional geometry.
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill	Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM) is an American architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm. It was formed in Chicago in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel A. Owings; in 1939 they were joined by John O. Merrill. The firm opened their first branch in New York City in 1937, and has since expanded offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai. SOM is one of the largest architectural firms in the world. They have designed several of the tallest buildings in the world, including the John Hancock Center (1969, second tallest in the world when built), Willis Tower (1973, tallest in the world for over twenty years), and Burj Khalifa (2010, currently the world's tallest building).
Skin effect	Skin effect is the tendency of an Alternating current electric current to flow towards the perimeter of a Electrical conductor and leave the center part of the conductor without (or barely) any electricity flow. This effect increases as frequency increases.
Skirt	A skirt is a piece of clothing that hangs downwards from the waist.Different skirts have been worn in many different cultures at different times. There are skirts that are clothing for woman, for men, or for both. In modern Western / European culture skirts are usually worn by women. An exception is the kilt and the fustanella, which are traditional skirts for men that are still worn today. Skirts are worn at semi-formal occasions, and sometimes at formal events, although a dress is more common. The bottom part of a dress can also be called a skirt.
Slash-and-burn	Slash-and-burn is a technique that has been used for thousands of years. Usually at the start of the dry season, a plot of land is cleared of its vegetation. Very often, this is done manually, for example using Machete. This can take a long time, clearing a hectare can take up to 120 hours of work. If the land is to be used for Crop that last Perennial, the Root need to be cleared as well. Usually this is not done for Annual plant. The plants cleared are left to dry, often for weeks. When they are dry enough, they are burnt. The ash that is created makes the soil fertile. Weed, and other Pest (biology) have also been eliminated, so the field can be used for agriculture. After three to five years, the extra fertility is gone, and the farmer usually moves ot another field (or again uses slash-and-burn).
Sleepwalking	Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, is a disorder belonging to the parasomnia family of sleeping problems. People with this disorder leave bed, without waking up, and walk around. In certain cases, people do things they also do in everyday life. According to research done, sleepwalking seems to be a problem related to the mechanism of waking up.
Sleeve	A sleeve is a piece of material which covers an arm. It is usually a part of a shirt or other garment.
Sliding door	A sliding door is a door that opens horizontally, by sliding. Very often, such doors slide along a wall. Sliding doors are commonly used, for example in the bathroom, to separate the shower. They are also used for Wardrobe. Sliding doors can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above. Some types slide into a space in the parallel wall in the direction of travel, rather than the door sliding along the outside of the parallel wall. There are several types of sliding doors, such as pocket doors, sliding glass doors, center-opening doors, and bypass doors. Sliding doors are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans. Compared with bifolds, which subdivide the glass multiple times and need stacking space when open, sliding doors are far neater.
Smart casual	Smart casual is a dress code that is neat yet casual. Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "neat, conventional, yet relatively informal in style, especially as worn to conform to a particular dress code". "Business casual" is another similar term. It suggests some formality, not really casual in fact. Different localities, kinds of events, contexts, or cultures have varying interpretations of the dress code.
Smart grid	The smart grid is a modern electrical grid that uses communication and information technology to collect information from the behavior of its customers. This is done so that it can automatically work itself to be more Energy efficiency and reliability in Electric power distribution electricity.
Snapchat	Snapchat is a photo sharing Application software. Using the app, people can take pictures, add a Writing or drawing and send them to a contact network. The service started in September 2011. At first it was intended to send selfies that would disappear quickly but people learned how to save the pictures. In June 2017 the app added "Snap Map". Snap Map is a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map. This caused concerns over privacy and safety.
Social Investment	Social Investments are resource inputs in any social groups or society that may bring about a social change.
Social cohesion	In psychology, social cohesion is a way of measuring, how close the members of a group are. If social cohesion is high, the members of the group ideally feel like a team. In this context, the group members may value the success of a task of the group higher than a task which only benefits them individually.
Social contract	A social contract or political contract is a perceived agreement among the people of a state about the rules that will define their government. These rules are usually called laws. Laws help to make sure people have rights and that their rights are protected. One kind of social contract is a constitution. A constitution says how decisions are made, and sets limits on the Influence of leaders and other people who have authority. In the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote books about social contracts. They saw good government as coming from social contracts. Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract. Both the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution use the theory of social contracts.
Social engineering (security)	Social Engineering (also known as „Social Manipulation“) is a type of confidence trick to influence people with the goal to illegally obtain sensitive data (i.e. passwords, credit card information). Social Engineers observe the personal environment of their victims and use fake identities to gain secret information or free services. In most cases Social Engineering is used to infiltrate third party computer systems to spy on sensitive data; in that case social engineering is also called Social Hacking.
Social isolation	Social isolation is having little or no with society. It often comes from being Social rejection by society. It is different to loneliness, which comes from a temporary lack of contact. Social isolation is different because it lasts a long time and is done on purpose. Social isolation sometimes begins early in life. It is often caused from being unemployed, sick or discrimination. Anybody of any age can be affected. Social isolation can mean staying home alone for a long time. Not seeing or speaking with anybody, even on the phone - this includes not answering if the call or try to talk first. Social isolation can also mean not having relationships, friendships or family connections that last a long time.
Social work	Social work is work done for the welfare of the society. A social worker is a trained individual who represents the social well-being of society. According to the Australian Association of Social Workers, "The social work profession facilitates social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are embedded in social work. Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and indigenous knowledges, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well being." Social workers are employed in human services track, like hospitals, clinics, NPOs, or publicly (government) as a staff that gives adequate welfare and helps who cannot independence including physically disabled people, person with other disability. Persons or professionals who engage in social work activities and social care services are not necessarily a qualified social worker, though within geographical differences they are accepted as companions of change. Research and the practice of social work focuses on areas such as: addictions and mental health, assessment and diagnosis, human development, psycho-social and socio-legal issues related to child and family welfare, community and social development, counselling, diversity, marginalization and oppression, policy analysis and development, psychotherapy, public administration, social planning, social policy and social program evaluation. Social workers are organized into local, national, continental and international professional bodies. It is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates theoretical bases from anthropology, ecology, economics, education, law, medicine, philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology and science.
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication	The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is an international communication network used by the banking and finance industries.
Sociocultural theory	Sociocultural theory was created by Lev Vygotsky as a response to Behaviorism. The main idea of the theory is that the ways people interact with others and the culture they live in shape their mental abilities. Vygotsky believed that parents, relatives, peers and society all have an important role in forming higher levels of functioning. Sociocultural theory, as stated by Cole, John-Steiner, Scribner, and Souberman, is the belief that "every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level." This means that the skills children learn first are related to interactions with others and they then take that information and use it within themselves.
Sock puppet (internet)	A sockpuppet is a false used on the Internet intended to hide a person's real identity. Another word to describe a sock puppet would be alter ego. Often, a sock puppet identity is used to promote ideas or gather intelligence Anonymity. Very often, they are used by individuals on the Internet praising themselves while pretending to be someone else. Politicians have frequently been accused of using sock puppets. [[:en:wikt:straw man|Straw man]] sockpuppets are designed to create political mischief (making fun of an opponent's position for example).<ref name=Gidlow136/> It can make it appear many people hold a certain opinion, when in fact that is false. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.
Sodomy	Sodomy is anal sex or oral sex. The word sodomy is derived from Sodom and Gomorrah in the Book of Genesis. Some countries have passed laws making sodomy a crime. Some of these sodomy laws have been overturned in the western world. In some places, they are not routinely enforced.
Soft Metal Music	Soft Metal Music is a genre of music involving metal music that is quite heavy enough to be considered heavy metal music. One notable song smells like teen spirit by nirvana. This genre includes sub genres such as Nu metal, grunge music, and heavy rock.
Software	Computer software, also called software, is a set of instructions and documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task. Software includes all different programs on a computer, such as Computer program and the operating system. Applications are programs that are designed to perform a specific operation, such as a game or a word processor. The operating system (e.g. Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Android (operating system) and various Linux distributions) is a type of software that is used as a platform for running the applications, and controls all user interface tools including display and the keyboard. The word software was first used in the late 1960s to emphasize on its difference from computer hardware, which can be physically observed by the user. Software is a set of instructions that the computer follows. Before compact discs (CDs) or development of the Internet age, software was used on various computer data storage media tools like paper Punched card, magnetic Floppy disk or magnetic tapes. The word firmware is sometimes used to describe a style of software that is made specifically for a particular type of computer or an electronic device and is usually stored on a Flash memory or ROM chip in the computer. Firmware usually refers to a piece of software that directly controls a piece of hardware. The firmware for a CD drive or the firmware for a modem are examples of firmware implementation. Today, software has become an important part of our lives. software is used everywhere. software engineers are responsible for producing fault-free software which has literally become an essential part of our daily lives. Changeability and conformity are two of the main properties of software design. There are also different processing models for designing software including Build and Fix, Waterfall and Agile software processing design methods.
Software agent	A software agent is a piece of software (a computer program) that is capable of making simple decisions to solve a problem. Usually, agents solve problems by interacting with other agents, or with their environment.
Software as a service	Software as a service is the idea that clients access and use software using a thin client or a web browser. The software itself is running on computers accessible through the Internet ("in the cloud"). Clients usually pay a fee to get access to the software. The benefit of this approach is that clients do not need to manage the software installation, and that they also do not need expensive hardware. One of the problems is that the data is also on the site of the company running the software - that is "in the cloud". Getting the data may be difficult, if the software vendor goes bankruptcy.
Software bug	A software bug is a problem with the code in a computer program which makes it not work properly. They can cause inconvenience to the user and may make their computer crash or freeze. Most computer programs have bugs. A program that has a large number of bugs (or possibly a single or a few serious bugs) is said to be buggy. Most bugs are caused by bad programming by the developer, but sometimes they can be caused by compiler problems. When bugs are found, people send bug reports to the developer to tell them about the bug and let them fix it. Sometimes, people say that their computer has a bug when something is wrong with it. The problem is usually caused by a computer virus which has infected their computer and is making it slow or do different things. Some bugs are harmless, for example, many video games incorrectly allow objects to move through walls. Other bugs are more severe, for example, a bug in a navigation system that causes an airplane to explode.
Software development	Software development is the process of creating a computer software. It includes the software release life cycle of preparing a design, coding the computer programming, and fixing the Software bug. The final goal is software release of a product that serves the wishes of User (computing). Software product is usually a result of research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities. There are 3 main goals of software development:
Software piracy	Software piracy (officially called copyright infringement of software) refers to the illegal copying of software. It often uses the Internet. Some countries have laws about this. The problem is considered to be bigger in certain countries than in others. Those who hold the copyright get less money because of copyright infringement. As a result of this, some copyright holders publish “anti-piracy” campaigns to tell people about the effects of infringement. Very often, the people making the laws have to make a trade-off between allowing people to copy and use the software, and the copyright holders charging for the content. At the same time, even not allowed distribution makes the content more popular. Because of these two reasons, infringement of copyright for proprietary software and content can be bad also for free software and content. In 2010 to 2012, the entertainment industry advocated changes to United States law to make it easier to end piracy websites, called Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act. Some websites including the English Wikipedia protested these proposals on January 18, 2012. The next day, the United States Department of Justice seized the Megaupload website which is claimed to be one of the largest piracy websites.
Software release life cycle	A software release life cycle is the different stages of making a Software, giving it out to other people, and making sure the computer program works right after it is released. Stages can either be officially announced and regulated by developers, or sometimes the term is used to describe the state of the product.
Software testing	Software testing takes place during software engineering. It is done before the software release to the final audience. Software testing is meant to see how the software works under different conditions. These conditions might be different depending on what the audience is. Testing is done to understand if it will work correctly, partially fail to work properly, or totally fail to work properly. Each test may be used to see how one, or many, parts of the software work at a point in its development. Proper performance may be based on specific (written) s or standards (which might, for example, be usability). Bad performance, or poor quality, might cause an unhappy audience. This could cause more work needing to be done on the software and higher money. A review of the results of tests may show that some parts of the software system may need to be done again, or may work well. Some bad performances or software bugs may need to be fixed. After more work on the software, testing may be done again. For larger software systems, tracking may take place checking completeness of the set of tests, test results, and how quickly any problems are fixed. All this information can be used for decision making about how ready the software is, and when it could be released to the final audience. Software testing may be done with separate parts of the software, with a group of these parts, or with the entire software. Software testing may be done by allowing the software to be used by a small number of people who the software is meant for, under controlled settings. It is then tested with a larger group of people under less controlled settings (beta testing). Some related terms are unit testing, white box testing, black box testing, regression testing, manual testing, automated testing, testing tools, test plan, test case, test data and test coverage.

Soil	Soil is loose material which lies on top of the land. It has many things in it, like tiny grains of rock (geology), minerals, water and air. Soil also has living things and dead things in it: "organic matter". Soil is important for life on Earth. Because soil holds water and nutrients, it is an ideal place for plants to grow. Soil holds the roots, and lets plants stand above the ground to collect the light they need to live. Almost as important are the fungi. There are fungi which grow into plant roots, a symbiosis known as mycorrhiza. This helps trees grow. There are many other fungi that live by breaking down dead organic material: the remains of other living things. The broken down material is a main source of plant nutrients. Many animals dig into the soil and make the soil their home. The large animals use soil to make dens for sleeping and giving birth. The small animals live most of their life in the soil. Earthworms are famous for improving soil. This is because the holes they make let air go into the soil. The holes also let water go through. The soil also has many microorganisms living in it. Many of them eat the organic material in the soil. They use oxygen and release carbon dioxide. They also release mineral nutrients into the soil. Soil is different in different places on Earth. This is because the climate and rocks in the Earth are different in different places on Earth. Soils are usually thicker in places where ice sheets covered the ground during the Pleistocene ice ages. This is because the ice sheets ground the rock into powder as they slowly moved over the surface.
Soil erosion	Soil erosion is the washing or blowing away (by water or wind) of the top layer of soil (dirt). This is a serious problem for farmers. If the soil has eroded, the crops that make food will not grow very well. Soil erosion was a big problem in the Midwestern United States in the 1930s Dust Bowl. Erosion also leaves large sinkholes in the ground, which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse. Urban areas are usually protected from soil erosion, so not many buildings collapse from erosion.
Solar calendar	A solar calendar shows the earth's position compared to the sun. There are tropical solar calendars, sidereal solar calendars, non-solar calendars (like lunar - moon - calendars), and lunisolar calendars.
Solar cell	Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert light to electricity. They have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the Electric power transmission is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, consumer systems, e.g. handheld calculators or wrist watches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications. More recently, they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules connected to the Electric power transmission through an inverter, often in combination with net metering. Solar cells are regarded as one of the key technologies towards a sustainable energy supply.
Solar mass	Solar mass is a unit of measurement of mass. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about 332,950 times the mass of the Earth, or 1,048 times the mass of Jupiter. Masses of other stars and groups of stars are listed in terms of solar masses. Its mathematical symbol and value are:
Solar radius	The solar radius is the radius (half of the diameter) of the Sun. It is the same as . It is used to find out the sizes of other stars.
Solar time	Solar time relates to the amount of time which has passed according to orbit of the sun. A solar day is the amount of time it takes an object to go around the sun.
Solar year	The solar year (also called tropical year) is a calendar system based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The Gregorian Calendar is an example of a solar calendar. Each year is slightly more then 365 days in a solar calendar; which is why there are leap days every 4 years.
Solicitor general	A solicitor general is a specific job in common law places. Solicitors general in different countries may have different jobs or powers. Usually, the solicitor general is the government's lawyer. In the United States, the Solicitor General of the United States is the government's lawyer in Supreme Court of the United States. United States Congress created the job in the 1870s. About two thirds of the cases in the Supreme Court involve the government. The solicitor general does not always argue them personally. He or she can send an assistant or other government lawyer to do it. When the government loses a case in the lower court, the solicitor general decides whether or not to appeal it and make it a Supreme Court case. In Australia, the solicitor general also acts as the government's lawyer and represents the country in international cases.
Solid geometry	Solid geometry is the geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space. It includes the measurements of volumes of various solid figures (three-dimensional figures). These include Pyramid (geometry), Cylinder (geometry), cones, Sphere, and Prism (geometry). It is Euclidean geometry, but not plane (mathematics) geometry. Point (geometry) are defined as a defined position on a sphere. A "staight line" is the shortest path between two points which stays on the surface of the sphere. Euclid's account of spherical geometry is in his Euclid's Elements volumes XIXIII containing solid geometry, and in his lesser-known work the Phaenomena, which includes 25 geometric propositions. The actual discoveries were often made by others. The Pythagoreanism dealt with the Regular solid, like the cube and the sphere. The pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the Platonism. Eudoxus of Cnidus proved the pyramid and cone have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height. The equations for areas and volumes in two and three dimensions was proof by Archimedes. One of Archimedes' works was called On the sphere and the cylinder. He asked that a carving of the two solid figures be placed on his tomb. He specified a "right circular cylinder with height equal to its circumference" because he had used this in his proof. People use solid geometry for many purposes including engineering and the calculation of Perspective (graphical).
Solid-state chemistry	Solid-state chemistry, (also called materials chemistry) is the study of the chemical synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials. It focuses on non-molecular solids. It has much in common with solid-state physics, mineralogy, crystallography, ceramics, metallurgy, thermodynamics, materials science and electronics. It focuses on the synthesis of new materials and their characterization.
Soliloquy	A soliloquy is a special kind of Public speaking in a Play (theatre). In a soliloquy, the Fictional character speaks to themselves. Other characters of the play are not aware of what is said. That way, the character can share certain thoughts or emotion with the audience. There are many famous soliloquies in William Shakespeare's plays such as the "To be or not to be" soliloquy in Hamlet, the "Is this a dagger" and the "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" soliloquies in Macbeth, and the "Bottom's Dream" soliloquy in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Plays changed towards realism in the 18th century. Soliloquies became less common in plays.
Solo (music)	In musical performance, a solo is a musical composition or a section of a piece that is played or sung by a single performer. This performer is called a soloist. A soloist can be a singer or an instrumentalist. Solos are common in classical music and jazz. In popular music, a solo is an Improvisation melody played by a single performer, such as a guitar solo. In the country music genre a solo is known as a ride.
Solubility	Solubility is the ability of a substance (the solute), to mix into a liquid (the solvent). It measures the highest amount of substance mixed into a liquid solvent while they are both at equal amounts.When the two mix together it is called a saturated solution. Certain substances can mix into any amount of a liquid solvent. An example of this is ethanol in water. This process is better described as "miscible" (the ability to mix with one another). Solubility does not depend on the size, in fact even the large particles will eventually all dissolve. A solute is a substance that is dissolving in a solvent and is the smaller part of the solution. A solvent is the bigger part of a solution and is the substance that the solute dissolves in.
Solution	In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substances that are solvation are called solutes. The substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent. An example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar (which are crystalline solids), dissolved in a liquid (like water). Gases can dissolve in liquids. An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases. The amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution. The solution with the large amount of solute is called a concentrated solution; the solution with less solute is called a dilute solution. Examples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals. For example, brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.
Solvation	Solvation, commonly called dissolution, is the process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute. The solvation is the action of dissolving the mix to form the solution.
Solvent	A solvent is a substance that becomes a solution by [[:wikt:dissolve|dissolving]] a solid, liquid, or gaseous Solvation. A solvent is usually a liquid, but can also be a solid or gas. The most common solvent in everyday life is water. Most other commonly-used solvents are organic chemistry (carbon-containing) chemicals. These are called organic solvents. Solvents usually have a low boiling point and evaporate easily or can be removed by distillation, thereby leaving the dissolved substance behind. Solvents should therefore not chemical reaction with the dissolved compounds - they have to be Chemically inert. Solvents can also be used to solvent extraction soluble compounds from a mixture, the most common example is the brewing of coffee or tea with hot water. Solvents are usually clear and colorless liquids and many have a characteristic Odor. The concentration of a solution is the amount of compound that is dissolved in a certain volume of solvent. The solubility is the maximal amount of compound that is soluble in a certain volume of solvent at a specified temperature. Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning (e.g. tetrachloroethylene), as paint thinners (e.g. toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g. hexane, petrol ether), in detergents (citrus terpenes), in perfumes (ethanol), and in chemical syntheses. Inorganic solvents are used in research chemistry and in a few technological processes.
Solvent extraction	Solvent extraction, also known as Liquid–liquid extraction or partitioning, is a method to separate a compound based on the solubility of its parts. This is done using two liquids that don't mix, for example water and an organic chemistry solvent. Solvent extraction is used in the processing of perfumes, vegetable oil, or biodiesel. It is also used to recover plutonium from radiation nuclear fuel, a process which is usually called nuclear reprocessing. The recovered plutonium can then be re-used as nuclear fuel. In this process one of the components of a mixture dissolves in a particular liquid and the other component is separated as a residue by filtration. Solvent extraction involves crushing of oil seeds and oil seed cakes. From ancient time, vegetable oils were obtained by crushing oil seeds in village ghanis / kolhus / chekkus in India. At the beginning of the 20th century the vegetable oils industry was based on some 500,00 bullock-driven ghanis producing about 800,000 tonnes of oils. Slowly, in addition to these ghanis, power-driven ghanis (rotary ghanis made indigenously) imported expeller and imported hydraulic press plants started crushing oilseeds. Around this time many European countries and United States of America had established huge solvent extraction plants for recovering directly almost all the available oil in the oilseeds like Cottonseed and Soybean.
Song rhythm tracks	Song Rhythm Tracks are musician's backing tracks that are composed entirely of percussion and/or drums and arranged for a song. Specifically, they do not include any harmony or melody parts. They are neither (i) traditional song backing tracks, which include harmonic accompaniment, nor (ii) traditional rhythm tracks, which are not arranged for a song.
Sonic boom	A sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. When an airplane reaches the speed of sound, it makes a bang sound or an explosive noise that can be seen with the naked eye. This is often called "breaking the sound barrier." The visible part of a sonic boom is actually air that becomes squashed by Sound. The thunder that a storm makes is also a sonic boom caused by lightning forcing air to move faster than the speed of sound. The first plane to fly at a level altitude above the speed of sound was the Bell X-1 in 1947 and was piloted by Chuck Yeager.
Sound City Studios	Sound City Studios is a recording studio in Los Angeles, California. It first opened in 1969 in the Van Nuys neighborhood. Before this, it was a factory for the British musical instrument maker Vox (musical equipment). The studio became well known for having a unique sound, especially when drums are played in there. Because of this, many famous recording artists have recorded there. These include Johnny Cash, Nirvana (band), Fleetwood Mac, Metallica, and many others. Over one hundred albums recorded at Sound City were given music recording certification.
Sound check	A soundcheck, simplified as sound check is an activity that takes place a couple of hours before a concert. The performer(s) and the Audio engineering run through a short song to make sure that the sound in the venue is clear and at the right volume and tonal frequencies. Soundchecks are especially important for popular and other musical genres that use heavily-amplified PA systems; having correct sound is very important to the success of such events. A soundcheck remains part art and not all science, however, because the acoustics of a venue often change somewhat once it is filled with an audience. Artists who change their set list during the course of a concert tour often use soundchecks as a rehearsal opportunity to try out new material or revive old material, before possibly introducing such material into the concert properly.
Sound of...	Sound of... is a yearly BBC poll of music critics and industry figures. The people polled say who they think is the most promising new music talent. It was first done by the BBC News website in 2003. It is now widely covered by the corporation's online, radio and TV outlets, as well as other media. A longlist of 15 artists is published each December. A ranked shortlist and the yearly winner is announced the following January.
Source code	In computer programming, source code is (generally speaking) a text file version of a computer program or computer software that contains instructions that the computer follows to do something. Source code is written in a programming language which a human can read and change. A large program may contain many different source code files that all work together. Source code is in many cases compiled before running it. That means translating the code into assembly language or machine language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read, but hard for a human to read. Another very common way is to interpreter (computing) the code, without needing a compilation step, while that's generally slower. A computer program may be open source, which means the source code is shared with anyone who wants to look at it and change it. Many programs are however closed source, which means only the executable code is distributed and people are not allowed to look at and change the code. Many open source programs are also compiled to such code, that may or may not be allowed to be inspected, while to change it is most convenient to change the source code that came with it, or possibly can be downloaded.
South African braille	South African braille is a written language. It is a form of braille. It is a way of putting bumps on paper so blind people can read words with their fingertips. Eleven languages are official in South Africa. Each of these languages is also written in Braille. English is written in Unified English Braille. The other languages use a basic Latin alphabet, but they add Diacritic. Punctuation is the same as in English braille.
Spache Readability Formula	Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of write is (its textual difficulty). The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called unfamiliar. The number of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text. Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight. the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level According to Oleander Solutions (http://www.oleandersolutions.com), the revised Spache Formula is: GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) + .659 Where: GL = U.S. grade levelASL = Average sentence lengthUW = Number of unique unfamiliar words
Spanish alphabet	The Spanish alphabet is a Latin script of 27 letters used to write the Spanish language. It has the same letters as the ISO basic Latin alphabet with the additional letter ñ, which is named eñe (pronounced EN-yay). In addition to letters, the alphabet also uses accent marks to mark Syllable stress. The Spanish alphabet is fairly phonemic, which means words are usually spelled the way the sound. While different Accent exist in Spanish like with any living language, pronunciation is usually fits well with spelling.
Special effect	Special effects are used in movies to create images that do not exist. There are many different types of special effects, for example, making little Scale models or using computer animation. Action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money. For example, if an action movie shows a very big warship blowing up, it would be expensive to buy a battleship and dangerous to blow it up. Most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blow up. It is cheaper and safer to make a little model of a battleship and blow that up. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movie movies also often use special effects. They usually tell imaginary stories, often set in imaginary places, that would be impossible to film. For example, in a science fiction movie about a world with three suns, artists could create a computer image of three suns which would appear in the . Using a computer to create special effects is called "computer generated imagery" (CGI) or "computer animation". Most science fiction movies from the 2000s use a lot of CGI.
Spectral line	A spectral line is the way scientists can tell one element from another by looking at color.
Spectrograph	A spectrograph is an instrument that breaks up a wave (physics) into a frequency spectrum. These could be sound, light or radio waves. For example the frequency spectrum of light is the brightness (intensity) and the amount of each colour. There are several kinds of machines called spectrographs, used to look at different waves. The term was first used in 1884. A spectrograph is closely related to a polychromator.
Spectrum of a ring	The spectrum of a ring is a thing studied in the branch of mathematics called algebraic geometry. This construction allows us to think of abstract mathematical objects as "functions" acting over some geometric space. In this case, the most natural geometric space is called the spectrum of the ring.
Speculation	Speculation has a special meaning when talking about money. The person who speculates is called a speculator. A speculator does not buy Goodsprings, Nevada to own them, but to sell them later. The reason is that he wants to make a profit from the change in price. One tries to buy the goods when they are cheap and to sell them when they are expensive. There is a good chance to profit as long as the market price of a good changes often in different directions. Speculation includes the trade of stocks, bond (finance), commodity, currency, collectibles, real estate, derivative (finance) or any valuable financial instrument. It is the opposite of buying because one wants to use them for daily life or to get income from them (as dividends or interest). Speculation is one of the biggest market roles in western financial markets. The others are hedging, long term investing and arbitrage. Speculators do not plan to keep an asset for a long time.<ref>Macquarie Bank.Futures - Frequently asked questions .</ref>
Speculation tax	The Speculation and vacancy tax is a provincial property tax levied in the Province of British Columbia starting in 2019. It is an opt-out tax paid when the property is vacant. It is paid in addition to the regular property tax. The rate for this tax is a half per cent of a home's assessed value for owners who are residents of British Columbia (BC), one per cent for Canadians from other provinces and two percent for owners from other countries. Homes that are not exempt from this tax, pay it in addition to their regular property tax. This tax is not to be confused with Empty Homes Tax, which is also being levied on empty homes located in the city of Vancouver. All owners of homes in British Columbia are invited to fill out applications for exemption from this tax every year. If a home is owned by more than one person, for example a couple, all owners must complete a separate application for exemption. A part-owner who does not file for an exemption must pay the tax based on their proportional part of the assessed value even if the home is occupied. Tens of thousands of homeowners have not filed for exemption by March 30, 2019. The BC Goverment says the tax is a "key measure in tackling the housing crisis in major urban centres in British Columbia". It says that it took this action because the people who live and people who work in BC deserve to have affordable housing. According to the goverment, the tax is a part of it's 30-Point Plan to make housing more affordable. The tax is Targeted at Speculations who own homes in BC but do not pay taxes. It changes empty homes into occupied housing. It also creates revenue which will pay for affordable housing. This tax is levied on empty homes in most urban centers:
Speech disorder	A speech disorder or speech impairment is a persistent communication problem, caused by problems with Speech. People with speech impairments have problems making certain sounds, forming words, or combining these words into sentences. Common speech impairments are stuttering and lisps. Someone who cannot speak at all is called muteness.
SpeechWeb	A SpeechWeb is a collection of SpeechWeb applications. The collection or web of applications can be navigated using a SpeechWeb browser. The goals of the SpeechWeb are:1. Providing end users with voice only interfaces to remote applications.2. Providing software developers with a framework to build their user interfaces with. A SpeechWeb browser is a document or program allowing a human user to interact with a SpeechWeb application. A SpeechWeb browser can be implemented in XHTML+Voice, VoiceXML, or others. An example browser using XHTML+Voice is available here . A SpeechWeb application is an application that provides a special interface. The basic idea is that not much more than natural language is used to communicate with the applications. SpeechWeb applications also need to describe the possible input texts by publishing a JSGF.
Speed limit	A speed limit is a law limit on how fast a road vehicle can be driven. Some roads also have a minimum speed limit, which is how slow a vehicle is allowed to travel.
Speed reading	Speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be reading, so that the important facts of the text can still be understood. There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them.
Spelling bee	A Spelling bee is a spoken spelling competition. In a spelling bee, children are asked to spell words. The child who spells the most words correctly is the winner. Schools hold spelling bee competitions to encourage children to learning to reading. As well, spelling bees encourage children to learn about spelling words and improve their vocabulary. One type of spelling bee is the Scripps National Spelling Bee, in Washington, D.C. The United States National Spelling Bee was started in 1926 by The Courier-Journal, the newspaper of Louisville, Kentucky, Kentucky. Contests may have been held before that year. A key impetus for the contests was Noah Webster's spelling books. Webster's spelling books were an essential part of the curriculum of elementary school children in the United States for five generations. They were first published in 1786 and known as "The Blue-backed Speller". Now the key reference for the contests is the Merriam-Webster unabridged dictionary. In a Spelling Bee it is actually best to go first rather than last because words usually go by levels in a school competition, so if it goes from easiest to hardest you will most likely get the less difficult words.

Sphere packing	In geometry, Sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange spheres in space. Very often, the spheres all have the same size, and the space used is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem is part of packing problems. When it is generalised, not all the spheres need to have the same size, and spaces can be n-dimensional Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space. A typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.
Spherical geometry	Spherical geometry is the use of geometry on a sphere. It was started for cartography, as well as for making maps of stars. It is different from Euclidean geometry (which is always on a plane (mathematics)), and Non-Euclidean geometry. Point (geometry) are defined in the same way as they are in Euclidean geometry: A point is at a defined location on the sphere. A "staight line" is different though: It is the shortest path between two points, which stays on the surface of the plane. Some theorems of Euclidean geometry cannot be used on the sphere, many of them have been adapted though.
Spoken language	Spoken language is language in its spontaneous form. It is different from written language. Many spoken languages have no written form. The term spoken language is sometimes used for oral language. This is not quite right because sign language is also sometimes said to be 'spoken'. Children get their first language from whichever language is spoken around them. Usually this comes from their mothers. Spoken language is much richer than written language. Spoken language can have different rules than written language.
Sport psychology	Sport psychology means applying parts of psychology to sports and athletes. One of the main ways that sports psychologists use is to help athletes meet their goals. The main group of people that sports psychologists try to help are professional athletes. They can help non-professional athletes as well. Sports psychologists mainly focus on problems the athlete has on the field but they can also help athletes with problems that they have off the field. Sports psychology did not become a recognized area of study until recently, but it has been used in the past.
Square (cipher)	In cryptography, Square (sometimes written SQUARE) is a block cipher Invention by Joan Daemen, Enrique Peña Nieto and Vincent Rijmen. The design was Publishing in 1997. SQUARE is a predecessor to the Rijndael key schedule algorithm, which has been adopted in 2001 as the Advanced Encryption Standard by the Federal government of the United States. Square was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen, called the "Square attack". The structure of Square is a substitution-permutation network with eight rounds, operating on 128-bit Block size (cryptography) and using a 128-bit key size. Square is not patented.
Squaring the circle	Squaring the circle is a problem of geometry. The problem is to construct a square (geometry) that has the same area as the unit circle, only by using a compass and straightedge construction method. Some people also call this problem the numerical integration of the circle. This is not about a circle with corners like a square. It is a problem like squaring a triangle. It is easy to construct a square with the same area as a triangle. Squaring the circle is related to the other ancient problems which have been proved impossible, squaring the cube and trisecting the angle. In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindenmann proved that this cannot be done because it is impossible to calculate √pi exactly, because it is a transcendental number.
St. Elmo's fire	St. Elmo's fire (also called St. Elmo's light) is a List of meteorological phenomena in which bright, glowing, ball of light is seen near pointed objects, like the mast of a ship. It is plasma (physics) made by a coronal discharge from a sharp or pointed object in a strong electric field in the air. These fields could be created by thunderstorms or a volcanic eruption. St. Elmo's fire is named after St. Erasmus of Formia. Elmo (and Erasmo) is the Italian name for St. Erasmus, the patron saint of sailors. The fire sometimes was seen on ships at sea during thunderstorms. Sailors believed the glowing ball of light may have been a religous event, and named it after St. Elmo. Electricity in the air can change compass readings, so some sailors may have seen the fire as a sign of bad luck and stormy weather. Other references claim that sailors may have thought of St. Elmo's fire as a good sign, showing that their patron saint was with them.
Stable	A stable is a building for livestock animals such as horses or cows to live in. A stable often has a loft where food such as hay can be kept to feed the animals in the winter. The stable may be divided into enclosures or stalls to keep the animals separate. A stable is most likely to be built near a House#Farmhouse.According to the New Testament, the baby Jesus was born in a stable. He was wrapped up and put to sleep on the straw in the feed bin (the manger).
Stained glass	Stained glass is glass coloured by adding metallic salts when it is made. The coloured glass is made into stained glass windows. Small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures. The glass is held together by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to improve the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln. Stained glass is much used in Christian art but other themes are not rare. It is still popular today, and often called art glass. It is often used in luxury homes and commercial buildings. Some colours are added to stained glass by the salts of:
Stall (flight)	A stall is what happens when an aerofoil can not make enough Lift (force) to keep the aircraft in flight. Stalling can be risky and dangerous when caused unintentionally or with lack of enough vertical distance for recovery.
Standard state	The standard state is a common way for measuring properties of chemicals. Standard state normally is room temperature (25°C) and normal atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi). Normally when no temperature or pressure is given, standard state is . If an article says "bromine is a liquid" it means bromine is a liquid in the standard state.
Standard temperature and pressure	In order to be able to reproduce experiment, standard conditions for temperature and pressure have been defined in different fields of science. Very often these are also called standard temperature and pressure. The table below gives some examples:
Standardized test	A standardized test is a Test (assessment) that is done and scored in a consistent, or "standard", manner. Standardized tests are designed so that everything about them are standard. They are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner. Often they are used as a test to join an institution or gain a license of some sort. The grading system is the same no matter where they are taken. They can be used for university entry, like the SAT and ACT in the United States or the National Higher Education Entrance Examination in the People's Republic of China. They can be used a requirement to get a job, like the LSAT for lawyers. In the United States the term is often used for the multiple-choice questions used in the educational system. They are thought by some to be a poor way to measure educational progress. They are, however, convenient and cheap. Marking does not require expertise in the subject-matter. Many psychological tests are designed to be standardized. They are designed to be "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior". The first known standardized test was in Imperial China, when Empress Wu allowed anyone who passed the test to be a government official based on their Meritocracy rather than birthright, meaning that people work to become leaders rather than being born into leadership. However, we do not know the details of this system.
Standing (law)	In law, standing means that a person is allowed to file a lawsuit in court. A person only has standing if the result of the lawsuit will impact that person. There are usually other rules which affect standing.
Stanford prison experiment	The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a psychology experiment to see the effects of becoming a prisoner or a prison guard on human behaviour and psychology. The experiment ran from 15-21 August 1971, led by Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University. In the experiment, 24 student volunteers were assigned to be either a ‘guard’ or a ‘prisoner’ in a fake prison at the flip of a coin, and Zimbardo was the [[:en:Prison_warden|prison superintendent]]. They were paid 15$ a day. The experiment was intended to run for 2 weeks, but some of the guards quickly became Authoritarianism and began psychologically torturing the prisoners, and the experiment had to be stopped after only 6 days. 5 prisoners left the experiment early, after having severe psychological stress. Zimbardo concluded that certain situations can cause good people to behave in a way that they normally would not have predicted. The Stanford Prison Experiment is used in many introductory psychology textbooks to show the impact of power and authority on human behaviour.<ref name=":1" /> The experiment is controversial for a few reasons: [[:en:Demand_characteristics|demand characteristics]], which causes the participants to behave in the way they think the researcher wants them to behave. There are other ethical issues with the SPE, and Zimbardo has been criticised for interpreting the results to fit his previous expectations.<ref name=":1" />
Star chart	A star chart is a graphic device or diagram which shows the night sky as seen from Earth. They are one of the oldest types of written or carved communication. There is a claim for a prehistoric carving as the first known star chart, but the evidence is not clear. Star charts occur in Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian wall decorations and writing. In the ancient world, knowledge was needed for practical reasons and for religious reasons. Early star charts were used for all these purposes. Even today, they are used for both astronomy and astrology. In the renaissance, with its interest in ideas, hundreds of books were printed with star charts and other diagrams. The key point for scientific charts is the use of data taken from observations, and listed in table (information) or databases. Historically, the first tables were in Ptolemy's Almagest (~AD 150). It has the last known star table from antiquity, with 1,028 stars.
Static electricity	Static electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects. This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground, or loses its charge quickly by a discharge. Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated. A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see, feel and even hear the spark. This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized. This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor (for example a path to ground). Other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge.
Station-to-Station protocol	The Station-to-Station (STS) protocol is a cryptography (information-hiding) key agreement scheme based on the classic Diffie-Hellman key exchange that provides mutual key and entity (party) authentication. In addition to protecting the established key from an attacker, the STS protocol uses no timestamps and provides perfect forward secrecy. It also requires two-way explicit key confirmation, making it an Authenticated key agreement with Key Confirmation (Acronym: AKC) protocol. STS was originally presented in 1987 in the context of ISDN security , finalized in 1989 and generally presented by Whitfield Diffie, Paul van Oorschot and Michael J. Wiener in 1992.
Stator	A stator is the part of a Rotation system that does not move. It is the fixed, part of an electric machine (motor or generator). The stator might act as the field magnet (working with the armature to create the spinning movement) or as the armature (receives influence from the moving field coils of the Rotor (electric)).
Statute	A statute is a written law passed by a state or Federal government of the United States legislature that creates a rule or [[Wikt:regulation|regulation]]. Statutes (also called legal codes) provide the authority for other laws. Many state and federal agencies, such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, United States Environmental Protection Agency and state Secretary of State may issue regulations for the areas of the law they cover. When there is a dispute over the meaning of a statute, a state or federal court may issue a judgment that [[Wikt:interpret|interpret]]s the statute more clearly. When this happens it also becomes case law.<ref name=NOLO/> Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive branch in the government. Then it is published as part of a legal code. In many countries, statutes are organized (or Codification (law)) for a particular jurisdiction. In many nations statutory law is distinguished from and is [[Wikt:subordinate|subordinate]] to Constitution.
Statute of Kilkenny	The Statute of Kilkenny were a set of laws made by the England in 1367 to try and save the English colony in Ireland. The laws were made by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence. They were passed at a meeting of the Irish parliament held at Kilkenny.<ref></ref> The English had difficulty in taking over Ireland. The first English settlers, the Anglo-Irish, began to become Irish in the way they viewed the world. They began to put their own interests ahead of those of the English royalty.<ref name=joyce></ref> The government of Ireland had become weak after the battles with Edward Bruce, and the arrival of the Black Death weakened the country even more. Edward III of England became concerned that the Anglo-Irish were becoming too powerful and threatened his rights and interests in Ireland. He attempted three times to control their increasing independence. Edward III finally sent his third son, Lionel of Antwerp, to Ireland to try and get back control. He was very concerned that the Anglo-Irish had become more Irish than the Irish themselves.<ref name=joyce/> The Statute of Kilkenny were laws designed to bring Ireland back under the control of English born nobles, not English in Ireland. These laws were serious, to break one was seen as treason and could be punished by death.<ref name=joyce/>
Statute of limitations	Statutes of limitations are laws passed by a Legislature in common law systems that set the maximum time after an event when Legal case may be filed. In civil law (legal system) systems, similar provisions are typically part of their civil law or criminal laws and known collectively as periods of prescription. When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, the statute of limitations provides an absolute defense to the Cause of action. The intention of these laws is to make sure legal cases are brought to trial in a length of time. A statute of limitations restricts when a case may be filed, but is not a deadline for the completion of a case. If a case is filed during the period specified in the statute of limitations, the case may be heard and decided by the court even after that period expires.
Statutory rape	The term statutory rape means sexual activity with a minor that is not forced. It usually refers to when adults engage in sex with someone below the age of consent. In 95% of cases, the victim is female. They use terms like unlawful sex with a minor or unlawful carnal knowledge.
Steam (service)	Steam is an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and social networking computer program developed and distributed by Valve Corporation. Steam has its own store where the user can purchase video games and other software. It is available for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. Steam also has an application with fewer functions for smartphones which is available for Android (operating system) and iOS. Steam can also be used as a communication software, meaning that you can talk with people if they are your friends on Steam.
Stele	A stele is a stone or wooden , mostly taller than it is wide, that is built so that people will remember something when they look at it. Mostly it is decorated with the names and titles of the person that shall remind of. This is , carved in relief or painted onto the slab.
Stellar (payment protocol)	Stellar is a system for sending money through the internet. It is based on the Ripple (payment protocol) communication protocol and Computer software.<ref name=":0" />
Stereoisomerism	Stereoisomers are chemicals with the same atoms as each other but different shapes. Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula as each other but the atoms do not connect to each other in the same order. Stereoisomerism is also called "spatial isomerism." Stereoisomers are so unique because of spatial arrangements of atoms.
Steven Universe	Steven Universe is an animated series on Cartoon Network. It is about a young boy called Steven Universe, who is half gem (an alien race who are made of gem crystals) and half human, and follows his story with the Crystal Gems, a rebel group against the Gem Homeworld.
Stick figure	A stick figure is a simple drawing of a person made out of lines and circles. They are made of simple shapes, such as circles, lines and triangles. These are often the first way that children begin to draw people.
Stile	A stile is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the countryside. Where there is a footpath (a right of way) which goes through a field with animals, there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field. The stile is there instead of a gate. If there were a gate and there were animals in the field, the animals could escape if the gate were left open. Stiles are, of course, a problem for people who are disabled. There are many stiles in the countryside in the United Kingdom. Another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a kissing gate.
Still life	A still life is a work of art, most often a painting. In a still life, objects like flowers, fruit, or glasses are arranged in a certain way, and then painted. Most still lifes are of inanimate objects manmade or natural.Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century, when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art. However, the idea is old: examples can be found in Ancient history. With a still life, the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting, such as landscape painting or portraiture. <gallery>Image:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|Transparent bowl of fruit and vases.

Stimulant	A stimulant is any of a group of drugs that can increase alertness and awareness, usually for a short time only. Most stimulants have more side-effects than other drugs. Some are classified as illegal drugs, most can cause addiction. For this reason, most legal stimulants are only available on prescription. Stimulants act on the nerves: Stimulants cause more neurotransmitters to the synapse (this is the gap between different nerves) Most stimulants fall into one of the following groups:
Stimulus (psychology)	A stimulus in psychology is an energy change (such as light or sound) which is received by the senses. The usage changes somewhat according to which school of psychology is using it:
Stoa	Stoas are unique to Ancient Greece architecture. They were covered Sidewalk or porticos, mainly for public use. Early stoas were open at the entrance with columns, usually of the Doric order, lining the side of the building. They were well suited for the mild climate of Greece. Later buildings of this style had two floors. A roof supported the inner s. On the second floor were shops or offices. They followed Ionic order architecture. Merchants could sell their Good (economics). Artists could display their artwork. Religious gatherings could take place. Stoas usually surrounded the marketplaces of large city.
Stock	In Finance markets, stock is the Capital (economics) that a firm gets by giving out and distributing Share (finance). A person or organization which holds shares of stocks is called a shareholder. The whole value of the stocks that a firm has issued is called its market capitalization. Stocks can be bought and sold from the stock exchange. Someone who buys and sells stock is called a stockbroker. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term share is used the same way as stock is described in the United States.
Stockholm syndrome	Stockholm syndrome is something that sometimes happens to people who are victims of kidnapping. In Stockholm syndrome, the victim starts feeling loyalty toward the person who kidnapped him or her and even start to have feelings for the person. It got its name from a bank robbery in Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. There was a bank robbery where two thieves held four people as hostage. After the thieves were arrested, the hostages defended them publicly.
Stocking	A stocking is a piece of women's clothing, worn like socks. They are made of stretchy materials. They are often worn instead of tights or socks. Stockings that are similar to woman's stockings are also made as parts of sport uniforms.
Stoichiometry	Stoichiometry is a branch of science that studies and measures the amount of matter in chemical reactions. It can be used to predict the amount of things that will be made in a chemical reaction. It uses the law of conservation of mass, the law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions in balancing chemical equations. [[zh:化学计量学]]
Stone slab	A stone slab is a big stone, flat and of little thickness, that are generally used for paving floors, for covering walls or as headstones. Other definitions refine the meaning a bit more:
Stonemasonry	Stonemasonry is the craft of making things out of stone. People who do this are called stonemasons. Their crafts have existed since the start of civilization. They have made important buildings and structures out of stone. This stone comes from the earth. Stone has been used to build many long-lasting things. These could be monuments, Artifact (archaeology), cathedrals and cities. These can often be seen in many cultures. Some monuments made out of stone include, the Egyptian pyramids and the Ancient Greece Parthenon. Stonehenge is also a famous stone building.
Strap	A strap, sometimes also called strop, is an stretched flap or ribbon, usually of leather or other flexible materials. It is used to keep things in its place.
Stream cipher	In cryptography, a stream cipher is a Symmetric-key algorithm cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream (keystream) using an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the Plaintext Numerical digit are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state. An alternative name is a state cipher, as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state. In practice, the digits are typically single bits or bytes. Stream ciphers represent a different approach to Symmetric-key algorithm encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly; for example, in particular, the same starting state must never be used twice. A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient Key (cryptography), for example Key size. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one-time pad encryption algorithm. However, because the keystream is pseudorandom, and not truly random, the security associated with the one-time pad cannot be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.
Stream of consciousness	Stream of consciousness refers to the flow of thoughts in the consciousness mind. It was a term used by the Americans psychologist and philosopher William James in 1890. James said:
Stream of consciousness writing	Stream of consciousness is a term used in literary criticism for a literary technique that reports the thought processes of a person. If it is done in context with the surrounding world it is called interior or internal monologue. That means it is unspoken, and in some cases coould not be spoken. For example, in Mikhail Bulgakov's Heart of a Dog (1925) the first chapter is entirely based on the dog's unspoken thoughts on the world about him. Stream-of-consciousness writing is typical for the Modernist literature. The term was coined by William James in 1890 in his Principles of Psychology. The use of the term in literature is [[:wikt:attribute|attributed]] to May Sinclair. Several famous works that employ stream of consciousness are:
Streaming media	Streaming media is multimedia where the user receives the media constantly using a platform over the Internet. Some examples are Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for movies and television series; and Spotify and Apple Music for music and other audio.
Street art	Street art is like impressionism, cubism or pop art an art movement. A lot of poor people try to survive by asking a little money in the street. They sometimes do the same while making art. These are the "original", "true" street artists. They make music, theatre, temporary paintings on the ground. The other ones are more likely called "urban artist".
Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design	Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design is an international school for architecture located in Moscow, Russia. The institute works with students from all around the world to solve problems relating to urbanism and urban development. The institute is a nonprofit project by the Russian government. It began in 2009. In 2014 the institute won a prize from the Domus Magazine for the top 100 best schools of architecture of that year.
Strict construction	Strict construction means a restriction of judicial interpretation. In the United States the phrase is also commonly used more loosely as a term for conservativism among the judiciary.
Strict scrutiny	Strict scrutiny is the most standard of judicial review used by United States courts. It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to weigh the government's interest against a constitutional right or principle. The lesser standards are rational basis review and exacting or intermediate scrutiny. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States. The idea of "levels of judicial scrutiny", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), one of a series of test case (law) the constitutionality of New Deal legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions valid was Korematsu v. United States (1944). In Korematsu the Court upheld the government ruling 6-3 that the need to protect the country from espionage outweighed the rights of Mr. Korematsu.
Structural isomer	A structural isomer or constitutional isomer of a compound is another compound whose molecule has the same number of atoms of each element, but with logically distinct chemical bond between them. The opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism. There are many words that represents structual isomers. There are three kinds of constitutional isomers. They are #Skeletal isomerism, #Position isomerism, and #Functional group isomerism. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers.
Structure	In science, structure is a fundamental concept. It means the arrangement of parts. Examples are the Organ (anatomy) in a body, or crystals in a substance like granite. A structure may refer to buildings, machines and similar things made by people as well as to a Rock (geology) or a mineral, atoms or sentences. It always reflects the hierarchy of its parts.
Structured settlement	A Structured settlement is an insurance or financial arrangement that is negotiated to end a lawsuit. It is a legal agreement through which an insurance company agrees to make regular payments to a specific individual over a period of time. Structured settlements created as a way for insurance companies to payout settlements in installments as opposed to large lump sums. Structured settlements may benefit injured people whose settlements might result in their owing taxes, by allowing them to reduce or delay tax payments. They may also benefit younger people or disabled people by providing periodic payments of money over an extended period of time. Structured settlements require the paper holder (a name for the person who receives payments from the settlement) to wait before they will get money, by spreading payments over a number of years. However there are companies offering to buy such a structured settlement for upfront money. For example, a company might offer to buy a settlement that would be paid in 20 yearly payments for a one-time payment of lower value. Such financing may need to be approved by judge and the insurance company. In the United States, the sale of a structured settlement may result in tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code.
Strč prst skrz krk	Strč prst skrz krk () is a tongue-twister in the Czech language and Slovak language languages that means "stick a finger through the throat". Many people know the sentence for both being valid and having no vowels. Each syllable has a liquid consonant (a consonant that sounds similar to liquid), all of which are r. They happen a lot in many Slavic languages, of which Czech and Slovak also has l, and Czech also has m. It is often used as such a phrase when learning Czech or Slovak as a foreign language.<ref name=rpr/> Many words in Czech and Slovak have no vowels, such as , , and čtvrtsmršť. The last two are used to make talking easier. There are other sentences in Czech and Slovak with no vowels, such as prd krt skrz drn, zprv zhlt hrst zrn, which means "a mole farted through grass, having swallowed a handful of grains".
Student debt	Student debt is a form of debt that is owed by an attending, withdrawn or graduated student to a lending institution. The lending is often of a student loan, but debts may be owed to the school if the student has dropping out and left the school.
Studio	A studio is a place where an artist can work. Studios can be used for many things, such as photography, broadcasting, painting, making movies, television shows, animations, or music. The word comes from the Latin word, studium, which means to .
Studio 8H	Studio 8H is a television studio in New York City in the United States. The studio is a part of NBC Studios (New York City), where the NBC television network is, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. It is known for having the live recording of Saturday Night Live, which has been shown from the studio since the show's creation in 1975.
StyleTap	StyleTap is a Palm OS simulator/compatibility layer/emulator for Windows Mobile/Windows CE, Symbian OS, iOS and Android (operating system). It emulates Palm OS 5.2 and earlier. Applications made for Palm OS work just like applications made for the operating system StyleTap is running on. StyleTap works on these platforms:
Subdomain	A subdomain is the portion shown before a domain name, separated by a full stop For example, a domain might look like this
Sublimation	Sublimation is the process by which a solid transforms into a gas without passing through the liquid stage. It occurs when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Most substances can sublimate only at low pressure. Many can sublimate in Outer space. Sometimes snow undergoes sublimation as well. This is most likely to occur on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day, but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first. At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process. CO2 changes from dry ice, a solid to a gas without being a liquid. Also diamond, graphite, iodine, ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure.
Subliminal stimuli	Subliminal stimuli are sensation#Sensory system just "below the threshold" of a person's conscious perception. They may be designed to influence the mental processes or the behavior of the individual without beiing noticed. A recent review of functional magnetic resonance imaging (Functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies shows that subliminal stimuli activate certain parts of the brain, but the subjects do not notice the stimulus. Visual stimuli may be quickly flashed before an individual can process them, or flashed and then masked, thereby interrupting the processing. Audio stimuli may be played below audible volumes or masked by other stimuli.
Subsidiarity	Subsidiarity is an idea that things should be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralised authority. The idea is that the top authority should only do things which cannot be properly done at a lower or local level. It applies to many areas of life.
Subsistence farming	Subsistence farming is the kind of farming done by farmers who have small plots, enough only for themselves. Literally, subsistence agriculture means no extra food is produced to sell or trade. This means farming doesn't give them money to buy things. However, today most subsistence farmers also do trade to some degree. From time to time they may need money to buy essential things to keep going. Subsistence farming may also mean shifting farming or nomadic herding (see nomadic people). Examples:
Subsolar point	The subsolar point on a planet is when its Sun looks like it is directly overhead (in zenith). For planets with a rotation like the Earth's, the subsolar point will move westward, circling the globe once a day.
Substitution box	In cryptography, a S-Box (Substitution-box) is a basic component of symmetric-key algorithms. In block ciphers, the S-Boxes are used to make the relation between the key and the ciphertext (coded text) difficult to understand–Claude Shannon property of confusion and diffusion. The S-Boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis (decoding). In general, an S-Box takes some number of input bits, m, and transforms them into some number of output bits, n: an m×n S-Box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2m words of n bits each. Fixed tables are normally used, as in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the Key (cryptography); e.g. the Blowfish (cipher) and the Twofish encryption algorithms. Bruce Schneier describes International Data Encryption Algorithm's modular multiplication step as a key-dependent S-Box. One good example is this 6×4-bit S-Box from DES (S5):
Substitution cipher	A substitution cipher is a form of cryptography. In a substitution cipher, a rule is used to change each letter of the message, one at a time. The rule says to replace (or "substitute") each letter with another letter from the alphabet. For instance, this table gives a rule for a substitution cipher:
Substitution-permutation network	In cryptography, an SP-network, or substitution-permutation network (SPN), is a series of linked Mathematics operations used in Block cipher such as Advanced Encryption Standard. These networks consist of Substitution box and Permutation box that transform blocks of input bits into output bits. S-boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits. A good S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits. It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit. P-boxes permute or rearrange bits across S-box inputs. In addition, at each round the key (cryptography) is combined using some Group theory operation, typically XOR.
Suda	The Suda or Souda () is a massive 10th century Byzantine Empire encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world. It is an Encyclopedia dictionary, written in Greek language, with 30,000 entries. The derivation is probably from the Byzantine Greek word souda, meaning 'fortress' or 'stronghold'. The Suda is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense. It explains the source, derivation, and meaning of words according to the philology of its period. There is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work. It is the articles on literary history that are valuable. These entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost. This lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political, ecclesiastical, and literary history in the East down to the tenth century. The chief source for this is the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912–959), and for Roman history the excerpts of John of Antioch (seventh century). The work deals with Bible as well as paganism subjects, from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christianity. A prefatory note gives a list of dictionaries from which the lexical portion was compiled, together with the names of their authors. The work is uncritical, and probably much added to, and the value of the articles is very unequal. Nevertheless, it contains much information on ancient history and life. The Souda has a near-contemporaneous Islamic parallel, the Kitab al-Fehrest of Ibn al-Nadim.
Sui iuris	Sui iuris is a Latin language phrase that is used in law. Sometimes, the phrase is also spelled sui juris. It literally means of its own right. It is used to say that the law status of an institution or entity is not comparable to anything else, and there are special laws that say how this institution or entity should work. An example use is in Canon law: The Roman Catholic church say that certain churches are sui iuris. That way the Eastern Catholic churches have their own government, and laws. Despite this, these churches still recognize the Pope of Rome as their spiritual leader.
Suicide	Suicide is when a person chooses to kill themselves. When someone kills themselves, people say that they have "committed suicide" "completed suicide" or "died by suicide”. When a person thinks about killing themselves, the person is described as suicidal. When people start Suicidal ideation, it is a medical emergency. They should get a suicide risk assessment as soon as possible. They should not be left alone. There are many reasons why a person might think about suicide. Most people who are suicidal have some type of Mental illness. They may have a chronic condition, which means it has been going on for a long time. But it may be an Acute (medicine) condition , which means the first symptoms of mental illness happened rather quickly. Depression (mental illness) is the mental illness that most often causes a person to have suicidal thoughts. Depression may also be a Signs and symptoms of other mental or medical disorders. Depression, which can lead to suicidal thoughts, has many possible causes. For example, it may also be caused by Chronic stress, and difficult events in a person's life, like losing a job or getting sick. Other causes of suicidal thoughts are bullying and inceldom. Suicide is one of the top three causes of death for young people aged 14–35 years-old. It is the second most common and the second leading cause of death for college students. Every 3 seconds, a person somewhere in the world tries to kill themselves. Every 40 seconds, someone dies by suicide. For every suicide, at least six other people are seriously affected.(WHO 2000) Although depression is the main factor in suicide, it is also Treatment and suicide is often preventable.
Sulfite	A sulfite is an ion that is made of one sulfur atom and three oxygen atoms; it has a charge of two minus. Sulfite is made when sulfurous acid (a solution of sulfur dioxide in water) is deprotonation. Salts containing the sulfite ion are called sulfites. Sodium sulfite is an example. Sulfites are weak reducing agents; they can be oxidation to sulfates. They are used to food preservation dried food. Some people have allergy to sulfite in food, and it makes them sick. It contains sulfur in the +4 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is SO32-.
Sulphate	In chemistry, a sulphate (sulfate in US English) is a salt of sulphuric acid. The sulphate ion is a group of atoms with the formula SO4 and two negative charges. It consists of a central sulphur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms. It occurs when sulfuric acid is deprotonation twice. If it is only deprotonated once, the hydrogen sulfate ion is made.
Sulphide	A sulphide (sulfide in US English) is an anion of sulphur in its lowest oxidation number of -2. Sulphide is also a term for thioethers, a common type of Chemical compound which are known for their bad odours (example: H2S = hydrogen sulphide). The dianion S2- exists only in strongly alkaline water solutions.
Superbase	In chemistry, a superbase is an extremely strong Base (chemistry). It is a compound that has a high affinity for protons. Hydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water (aqueous) solutions, but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases. Such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are to physical chemistry. Superbases have been described and used since the 1850s. Chemical reaction involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the air. Inert atmosphere techniques and low temperatures minimize these side reactions.
Superiority bias	Superiority bias is when people think too much of themselves without good reason. They overrate their positive qualities and abilities, and underrate their negative qualities (relative to others). Other phrases for this are: illusory superiority, the above average effect, leniency error, sense of relative superiority, the primus inter pares effect,<ref name="hoorens" /> and the Lake Wobegon#The Lake Wobegon effect. This was named after Garrison Keillor's fictional town where "all the children are above average".
Superman suit	The Superman suit is the costume of the fictional comic-book character Superman, a superhero appearing in DC Comics.
Supersaturation	Supersaturation in chemical solutions is when a solution contains more of a solute than can be dissolved in it. This usually makes some of the solute separate itself from the solution.
Supervillain	Supervillains, sometimes called supercriminals, are fictional characters generally appearing in comic books and in superhero movies as antagonists of superheroes. A Supervillain normally has powers that make him or her a threat that only a superhero can stop. A lot of Supervillains are enemies of specific superheroes. For example, the Supervillain Lex Luthor is an enemy of Superman, The Joker (comics) is an enemy of Batman, and the Green Goblin is an enemy of Spider-Man.
Supramolecular chemistry	Supramolecular chemistry is area of chemistry that studies the relationship and linking molecules into bigger systems. It focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of molecular subunits or . The study of Noncovalent bonding is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function. Systems biology are often the inspiration for supramolecular research.
Suprematism	Suprematism is an abstract art movement started in Russia, 1915/1916. It focussed on basic geometric forms such as the square (geometry) and circle. It is an example of geometric abstraction. Suprematism was founded by Kazimir Malevich. In his book The Non-Objective World, published abroad as a Bauhaus Book in 1927, Malevich described the inspiration which brought about the powerful image of the black square on a white ground:
Surcoat	A surcoat, or surcote, was an outer [[:wikt:garment|garment]] commonly worn in the Middle Ages by men. About 100 years later, women started to wear surcoats. It can either mean a coat worn over other garments or the outer garment commonly worn over armour. The name comes from the French language meaning "over the cotta", a long, wide coat reaching down to the feet without [[:wikt:sleeves|sleeves]]. Starting about the 12th century, knights wore long and [[:wikt:flowing|flowing]] surcoats over their armour. They would often show the coat of arms of the wearer. A knight's surcoat reached almost to the [[:wikt:ankles|ankles]].<ref name=Meller77/> It had slits (cuts) in the bottom front and back so a wearer could sit. It also had no [[:wikt:sleeves|sleeves]].<ref name=Meller77/> One purpose for the surcoat was to protect armour from the rain.<ref name=Meller77/> Another use was during the Crusades to keep the armour cooler in the sun.<ref name=Meller77/> By the middle of the 14th century the long surcoat was replaced with the "Jupon" (or "Gipon"). This was a much shorter garment, which was often padded for extra [[:wikt:protection|protection]]. Once suits of plate (solid) armour became common, the surcoat was no longer used.
Surface area to volume ratio	The surface area to volume ratio of an object is the relationship between two measurements. It is the ratio of Surface area to volume. It shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount inside. Small or thin objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio. A large lump, for example, has a small ratio, and may be smashed into powder to give it a large surface to volume ratio. Two common ways of writing it are sa/vol or SA:V. Either of these say to divide the surface area by the volume. This shows how much surface area is required for each unit of volume.
Surface runoff	Surface runoff is the excess water that flows over land when the soil below it is flooded. This is a big part of the water cycle. This a prime cause for soil erosion and degradation of soil.
Surfactant	A surfactant is a Chemical substance that lowers the surface tension of a liquid. Less surface tension lets the liquid soak into things better, and can also let bubbles form easier. A liquid that bubbles and soaks into things is better at cleaning, so surfactants are used in soap.
Surrogacy	Surrogacy means getting pregnancy and carrying a child for other persons/person who will become the child's parents\parent after their birth. Some reasons why people may look for surrogacy is if a single man wants a child, pregnancy is too much of a risk, or if a woman can't have children through their own pregnancy. The carrier of the children is called a surrogate mother. It may or may not involve monetary arrangements between the surrogate and the biological parents. In some countries like China, Japan, Germany and France it is considered illegal. In Australia and New Zealand commercial surrogacy is an offence. India is the main destination for this as surrogacy here is cheaper.
Surveying	Surveying is the Skill and science of accurately finding out the position of points and the distances and angles between them. These points are usually, but not always, associated with positions on the surface of the Earth. They are often used to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land. A person who does the surveying is called a surveyor. In order to find the information they need, surveyors use geometry, engineering, trigonometry, mathematics, physics, geology and law. Surveying has been very important in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history (ca. 5000 years ago) and it is a requirement planning of nearly every form of construction. Its most common uses are in the fields of transport, building and construction, communications, mapping, and the making of legal boundaries for land ownership.
Suspect	A suspect is a person believed to have done something wrong, committed a crime or caused something bad to happen. In criminal law a person who is under suspicion or under Criminal investigation by law enforcement is considered a suspect. A prime suspect is believed by police to be the suspect who most probably committed a crime. A formal suspect may be arrested when the facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe a suspect may have committed a crime or is about to.<ref name=USL/> In common law countries a suspect may have a defense attorney present while being questioned.<ref name=OConnor24>Vivienne O’Connor, 'Common Law and CivilLaw Traditions', INPROL (March, 2012), p. 24</ref> The attorney may advise his or her client (the suspect) how to answer questions.
Suspension (chemistry)	In chemistry, a suspension is a mixture of two or more components. In a suspension, very small pieces of solid are mixed in a liquid but do not dissolution. If left still, the solid pieces will separate from the liquid and either fall to the bottom or rise to the top. Sand in water and flour in water are examples of suspensions. Suspensions may separate quickly or stay suspended for a long time, depending on what they contain. If a liquid is suspended in another liquid, it is called an emulsion. Milk is an emulsion. If a liquid is suspended in a gas it is an aerosol. Mist is an aerosol.
Suspension of disbelief	Suspension of disbelief is the willingness for a person to accept fantasy as it is presented to them in any form of media.
Sutton Hoo	Sutton Hoo is the site of two Anglo-Saxons cemeteries dating to the 6th and early 7th centuries CE that is located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and Archaeology significance, which are now held in the British Museum in London. Other sites had produced significant finds, but had previously been looted. The ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, its meaning, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest of the burial ritual itself.
Sweatshop	A sweatshop is a place where people work, that is very crowded, where the work is very hard and the place is not safe to work in. Many sweatshops are in poor countries but sweatshops are also found in rich countries, where they often have people who are new to the country working in them, or people who are not Illegal alien. The amount of money people are paid in sweatshops is lower than the amount paid to workers in a richer country, but is often higher than the worker would earn in their old jobs on farms, or working in manual labour. Children may also work in sweatshops. People in sweatshops often make Clothing and shoes. Wristband#Awareness wristbands for charities have also been made by sweatshops.
Switchgear	A switchgear is a combination of electrical switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect or isolate electrical equipment.
Symmetric-key algorithm	Symmetric-key algorithms is a method in cryptography. It is when the Key (cryptography)s for decryption and encryption are exactly the same shared secret. You can generate the secret randomly, or from a password, or through a secret key-exchange procedure like Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Symmetric-key algorithms are very important because they are faster on computers than the other kind:public-key algorithms. In public-key cryptography (asymmetric-key cryptography) the key for encryption can be given to the public with no problem, and everyone can send you secret messages. The key for encryption is "open" because, in practice, it cannot be used to get the key for decryption. This is very useful, but public-key cryptography algorithms are very slow on computers, so they are only used to send a secret key. Then symmetric-key algorithms are used for everything else because they are faster. There are two kinds of symmetric-key algorithms, called stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers encrypt a message as a stream of bits one at a time. Block ciphers take blocks of bits, encrypt them as a single unit, and sometimes use the answer later too. Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used; though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard use 128-bit blocks. Examples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish, Serpent (cipher), Advanced Encryption Standard (aka Rijndael), Blowfish (cipher), CAST5, RC4, Triple DES, and International Data Encryption Algorithm. In history, some cryptanalysis methods exploited symmetry, so symmetric systems were less secure. Some attacks are called known-plaintext attacks, Chosen-plaintext attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. Other terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key, single-key, shared-key, one-key and eventually private-key encryption. This last term does not have the same meaning that the term private key has in public-key cryptography.
Symmetry	Reflectional Symmetry is a property of certain geometry objects that appears the same when mirrored or reflection along an axis. This axis has to cross the shape through the middle of that object dividing into equal halves. In rotational symmetry, the object is identical when it is rotated by a certain amount. The precise notions of symmetry have various measures and operational definitions. For example, symmetry may be observed
Synaptic Package Manager	Synaptic is a computer program which is a GTK+ graphical user interface front-end to the Advanced Packaging Tool for the Debian package management system. Synaptic is usually used on systems based on Deb (file format) packages but can also be used on systems based on RPM Package Manager packages. It can be used to install, remove and upgrade software packages and to add Software repository.
Syncopation	Syncopation is music which creates rhythmical variation. Examples would be:
Syndicated	Syndicated means a television programme being shown on a different television network than the one that first showed the program. A syndicated program can also be a program that was not made for a television network. These types of programs are made and then sold to many different television Broadcasts to be shown. There are different types of syndication:
Syngas	A Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a gas mixture that is mainly used for synthesis. In the broad sense of the term, this can be any synthesis, such as the synthesis of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, or Haber process. In the narrow sense of the word, only gas mixtures are covered, where the main component are carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. Common uses of such gases are:
Syntax highlighting	Syntax highlighting is where a text editor, Integrated Development Environment or other computer program shows different parts of some source code in different colours. This makes it easier for programmer to read the source code and understand what it does. It can be done in different colors, and different programming language have different rules about what parts of the source code need to be different colors.
System of Rice Intensification	The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a way to grow rice. This plan for farming may grow more rice in the same field. It uses less water, takes more work, and uses younger seedlings spaced apart. SRI calls for hand weeding with special tools. It was started in 1983 by the France Jesuit Priest Henri de Laulanié in Madagascar. Full testing and spread of the system throughout the rice growing parts of the world did not happen until some years later with the help of schools like Cornell University.
System requirements	System requirements refer to a checklist of minimum necessary items for a computer to have. These items would be requirements in order for an operating system to work, such as Windows XP. If the system did not have these things, the computer or operating system might crash or cause problems. If it exceeds minimum expectations, you could check the recommended system requirements, and see if it also meets those. If it does not, it is not bad. But if it does meet the recommended requirements, that is very good to knowledge.
TD Ameritrade	TD Ameritrade is a company that lets customers buy and sell stocks and other financial Security (finance). It has headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. The company received its current name in January 2006, when Ameritrade Holding Corporation acquired TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank and was renamed TD Ameritrade.
TV Guide (magazine)	TV Guide is an American weekly magazine about Broadcast programming. In addition to TV listings, the publication features television-related news, celebrity interviews, gossip and film reviews and crossword puzzles. Some issues also have horoscope listings.
Tailor	A tailor is a person whose job is to make clothes to fit people. A tailor might make a new piece of clothing, or change an item so that it fits better. They also mend (fix) clothes. A tailor is also called a seamster, or a seamstress for a woman. [[es:Sastre]]
Tailstrike	A tailstrike is when the tail of an airplane hits the runway. This can happen during takeoff or landing. During takeoff, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too early and the plane cannot take off in time. During a landing, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too high during landing. Tailstrikes usually do not have serious effects, such as killing people. However, this means that the airline has to spend money to repair the plane before it can fly again. If the plane is not repaired correctly, it may cause Fatigue (material) and in the end, the plane can crash.
Takeoff	Takeoff is the part of flight in which an aircraft goes from moving along the ground (taxiing) to flying in the air, usually on a runway. For balloon (aircraft), helicopters and some special aircraft (such as the Harrier Jump Jet), no runway is needed. Takeoff is the opposite of landing.
Talent	A talent (or gift, or aptitude) is the skill that someone has to do something very well that people usually like and that is difficult. Someone who has talent is called talented. Talented people may have more than one talent. Talent is sometimes learned, but in some cases is natural born. People often value talents that are entertaining, beautiful, or impressive for a different reason like Music, dancing, acting or sports. Even if someone has talent they may still have to work very hard if they want to perform well. Some people become quite good at something even if they do not have much talent, but if they are willing to work very hard at the skill for a period of time. The word talent used to mean a weight and a coin in Assyria, Greece and Rome. This is the sense in which it is used in the Bible in the Parables of Jesus of the five talents (Gospel of Matthew, xxv, 14-30).
Tangent (geometry)	In geometry, a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at one Point (geometry). At the place where they touch, the line and the curve both have the same slope (they are both "going in the same direction"). For this reason, a tangent line is a good approximation of the curve near that point. The curve and the tangent line are almost exactly the same near the intersection point.A line which touches a circle at a single point is Perpendicularity to the circle's radius and is considered tangent to the circle.
Tap changer	A tap changer is a component of a transformer. It controls the transformer's output voltage by adjusting its winding ratio within some range of step levels. The tap changer can be done manually or automatically and either when the transformer is energized (On Load Tap Changer; OLTC) or when it is off (Off Circuit Tap Changer; OCTC).
Task manager	A task manager is a computer program that is used to show information about the process (computing) and programs running on a computer. Task managers also show the general of the computer. They can be used to (end) processes and programs, as well as change the processes . An example of a task manager is Windows Task Manager.
Tatnet	Tatnet (short for "Tatar Internet") is the name Tatar language-speaking Internet users commonly use for the "segment of the Internet" about the Tatars or Tatarstan. It includes webpages and websites in many languages. The first e-mail message in Tatar was probably sent and received in 1991 when employees of the Tatar-Bashkir Service of Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe Inc. started using the Internet and electronic communication on a regular basis. In 1994, a Tatar-language mailing list (TMG, standing for Tatar Mailing Group) was established and this year is commonly regarded as the birthyear of the Tatar Internet. Since approximately 2000, Tatnet has been developing explosively, with many web pages and web sites added to it annually. The existence of Tatnet continues to contribute tremendously to the cohesion and consolidation of the Tatar people, a significant achievement because Tatars are despersed all over the world and a substantial majority of Tatars live outside their ethnic homeland, Tatarstan. Tatar Internet users employ Latin and Cyrillic scripts with the former gradually becoming more dominant.
Tax deduction	A tax deduction is a way to reduce the amount of income that is subject to a tax. Tax deductions and tax credits both lower the amount of money a person has to pay in taxes. But they do it differently. A tax deduction is subtracted from the income of a taxpayer. For example, if a couple had an income of $60,000 for the year, and they had paid $10,000 in interest on their mortgage, their taxable income would be reduced to $50,000. The value of a tax deduction depends on a person's tax rate, which rises with income. A tax credit, by comparison, has the same value for all taxpayers. In the US, there are hundreds of different tax deductions. Some are only available to taxpayers in certain income s. Some are available to businesses in particular industries.<ref name=InvAnsw/>
Tax evasion	Tax evasion is the evasion of taxes by trusts, by persons or business. The term tax evasion usually refers to when taxpayers deliberately misrepresent the actual state of their affairs to tax authorities to reduce their tax liability.This includes dishonest tax reporting, such as declaring less income or profit than the amounts which were actually earned. Tax evasion is an activity connected with the informal economy.
TeamViewer	TeamViewer is a software application for remote control, desktop sharing, online meetings, web conferencing and file transfer between computers.
Technical drawing	Technical drawing, also known as drafting or draughting, is the act and Discipline (study) of making detailed drawings. These drawings Communication how something works or how it is to be made.
Tel Aviv Bauhaus Center	The Bauhaus Center is a Art museum, shop and information center for the Bauhaus (modernism) architecture of Tel Aviv. It is a private institution, working together with public organizations such as Tel Aviv City Hall and UNESCO. It is located at 77 Dizengoff Street in the White City of Tel Aviv area.
Telegram (software)	Telegram Messenger is a messaging service which lets its users send each other messages, photos, videos and documents (all File format are supported). The Client are open source and the server is proprietary software (closed source)
Television	Telegram television (also known as a TV) is a machine with a screen. Televisions receive broadcasting Signal (electrical engineering) and change them into pictures and sound. The word "television" comes from the words tele (Greek language for far away) and vision (sight). Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter. A TV can show pictures from many television networks. Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs. The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread. At first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor. All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1950s these were usually "Monochrome", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors. Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners. That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen. Today flat panel displays are the usual kind. These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges. This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape. The early 21st century is also when digital television transmission became more common than analog television.
Television City	Television City, which is also named CBS Television City, is a television studio in Los Angeles, California. It was built in 1952 by Charles Luckman and William Pereira. They are architects. The television network, CBS make their television programs here. For example, the game show The Price is Right, the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, and the situation comedy, All in the Family were all made at CBS Television City.
Telnet	Telnet is a common network protocol used on the Internet and also inside a LAN (local network). It was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15 and is now defined as IETF STD 8, which is one of the first Internet standards. However, due to its lack of security, Telnet has been replaced with Secure Shell (SSH) on most servers. Telnet is one of the simplest ways to exchange data between two computers. It allows two computers anywhere on a computer network, including the worldwide Internet, to exchange text and other data in real time. It is still widely used for testing computer programs, and is simple enough that it is included on most computers today. But it allows many people to eavesdrop on the data exchange, which is why it has mostly been replaced by SSH.
Temperament	Temperament is a term from psychology to describe the way in which an individual behaves. Examples for temperament are introversion and extroversion. Many psychologists believe that the Trait theory called temperament are innate, and that they are not learning. Temperament also seems to be independent of the mood of the person or animal. Galen was among the first people to describe different temperaments, or humorism, as they were called at the time. Galen identified four types:
Templer architecture	Templer architecture was a style of architecture that was designed by the German Empire Templers (religious believers). The Templers were a group of religious believers that was a sect of the German Protestantism church. They built communities in Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Tenant farming	Tenant farming is when the person who works the farmland does not own the land themselves. The farmer pays rent to the landowner, either with cash or with a portion of the produce. When the rent is a share of the crop, it is sharecropping. Many freed slaves during the Reconstruction of the United States who owned no land became tenant farmers, renting land from a great landowner.
Tensor	A tensor is a Mathematics object. Tensors provide a mathematical framework for solving physics problems in areas such as Elasticity (physics), fluid mechanics and general relativity. The word tensor comes from the Latin word tendere meaning "to stretch". A tensor of order zero (zeroth-order tensor) is a scalar (simple number). A tensor of order one (first-order tensor) is a Linear mapping that maps every vector into a scalar.<ref name=danielson /> A vector is a tensor of order one.<ref name=danielson /> A tensor of order two (second-order tensor) is a linear map that maps every vector into a vector (e.g. a matrix).<ref name=danielson /> In linear algebra, the tensor product of two vector spaces V_1 and V_2, V_1 \otimes V_2, is itself a vector space. It is a way of creating a new vector space analogous of multiplication of integers.
Terrace (agriculture)	Terraces are small plots on water used for farming, closely relating to the New World. People dig into a hillside or other sloping surface and build it up so it is level in places, like steps. Terraces can be in rectangles or they can follow the natural shape of the land. Terracing prevents the rain from washing the soil away.
Terrace farming	Terrace farming (also called step farming) is a method of farming that consists of different "steps" or terraces that were developed in various places around the world. The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras (hills and mountains) is a World Heritage Site. It dates back two thousand years. This method of farming uses "steps" that are built into the side of a mountain or hill. On each level, various crops are planted. When it rains, instead of washing away all of the nutrients in the soil, the nutrients are carried down to the next level. These steps prevent water from washing away the soil and plants. This system also allowed them to build aqueducts, which carried water to each level. The idea was also independently developed by the Inca people. The Incas built their Aqueduct (water supply) so well that it is still used today.
Test case (law)	In case law, a test case is a legal action whose purpose is to set a precedent. An example of a test case might be a person who files a lawsuit in order to see if the court considers a certain law or a certain legal precedent in certain s. This is useful, for example, in order to later file similar lawsuits in similar circumstances. Sometimes, lawyers delay filing a lawsuit to wait and see how a test case is decided. Agency sometimes bring test cases in order to confirm or expand their powers.
Testimony	In law and in religion, testimony is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter. The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the Latin word testis, referring to the notion of a disinterested Third-party source witness.
Tetraoxygen	Tetraoxygen (O4), or oxozone, is a molecule made up of four oxygen atoms. It does not exist in nature anywhere and can only be made under extreme conditions in a lab. The molecule was first created in a lab in 2001.
Text grammar	A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence. It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas, facts, messages, and fiction. A similar term is discourse analysis. Both are mostly concerned with natural language use; discourse analysis would include spoken language. Speech is also the parent of rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasive speaking. In a similar way, literary criticism parallels text grammar, because both concentrate on the printed word. A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistics of a text, rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning. A text is a coherent body of sentences. Coherent means they are linked by a consistent theme. The text ends when completion is signalled. For example, when a problem introduced at the start is solved, or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion.
Text to speech	Text to speech (TTS) is the use of software to create an audio output in the form of a spoken voice. The program that is used by programs to change text on the page to an audio output of the spoken voice is normally a text to speech engine. TTS engines are needed for an audio output of machine translation results.
Textual criticism	Textual criticism is the study of different copies of books or manuscripts. The purpose is to find the original, and see what changes were made to the later versions. Textual criticism started with the study of the Bible, but now these techniques are used to study many texts.
Tharon	Thāron or Tharol is an ancient Meitei literary work (Puya (Meitei texts)), about the lore of the twelve lunar months of a year. It describes the changing pattern of nature in the following months. It is one of the masterpieces of the writers of the ancient times. The terms, "Tha" means month or moon and "ron", derived from "lon" means knowledge, lore or tradition. The names of the twelve lunar months were given in Ancient Meitei language in the manuscript. However, the following illustrates both the Ancient Meitei language as well as Meitei language names, with their Gregorian calendar equivalents:
Thatching	Thatching is building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw, reed (plant), Cyperaceae (Cladium mariscus), Juncus, Calluna, or palm branches. The vegetation is put on top of each other so as to make sure water stays away from the inner roof.
The Art of Worldly Wisdom: A Pocket Oracle	El oráculo manual y arte de prudencia or Manual oracle and art of prudence or The Art of Worldly Wisdom: A Pocket Oracle is a book written by Baltasar Gracián in 1647.
The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory	The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory is a book published in 1984 by Psychoanalysis and historian Jeffrey Masson. In the book, Masson criticizes Austrian Neurology (a person who treats the nervous system) Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) for abandoning the seduction theory, which held that neurotic illness in adults and adolescents was a result of their being sexually abused before puberty. Freud said that his patients confabulated the molestations and then rejected this theory. Masson says that Freud's original view was the correct one.
The Best of Rock za Hrvatsku	"The Best of Rock za Hrvatsku" (Rock for Croatia) was a popular album of anti-war and patriotic songs by many different song writers and bands (a compilation album). It was released in 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. Some of the artists whose songs were in this album were popular across Yugoslavia before it broke up, like Psihomodo pop, Jura Stublić, Parni valjak, Boa, and Aerodrom's Jura Pađen. They took a pro-Croatian stance as the Yugoslav Wars began, while other popular song writers and bands like Azra did not have their songs in the album because they broke up. The album also made some new people popular, like the dance group ET, rock band Thompson (band) and others. They would become the first specifically Croatian bands.
The Blank Slate	The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature is a popular 2002 book by the psychologist Steven Pinker. The author makes a case against tabula rasa (people who believe we are all born with no built in mental content). The book was voted for the 2003 Aventis Prizes and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
The Freecycle Network	The Freecycle Network (TFN) is a global network of people who share and regiving items. They organise their network through the Internet. Freecycle is a place for people to meet. There are just two things people can do there. The first thing is this: A person can ask the other people for an item. If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it. The second thing is this: A person can give away an item. Sometimes many people want the item, and the donator has to choose just one person.
The Land of Gorch	The Land of Gorch is a series of stories in episodes from the first season of the comedy television show Saturday Night Live. It was special because it included Jim Henson's The Muppets. Before he worked on Sesame Street, Henson had made his puppet characters for a more adult audience, including his show Sam and Friends. His characters were regular appearances on the late-night-comedy television shows including The Ed Sullivan Show. After Sesame Street, Henson was afraid that he would only be able to get work in the future on children's television series. His friend and advisor Bernie Brillstein, who also represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him move over from his prior work to Saturday Night Live. The idea behind The Land of Gorch was that it had Muppet characters in a far-away place, who were members of a royal family. They behaved rudely, with many references to drug abuse, sex, and drinking alcohol. Characters included King Ploobis and Queen Peutra and children, and servants Scred and Vazh.<ref name="mcara" /> These characters often spoke to their wise prophet Mighty Favog for advice.<ref name="bernsten" /> The staff of Saturday Night Live disagreed with Henson's ideas. Writers Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches involving The Land of Gorch. Frank Oz agreed in the end that the match was not perfect between Saturday Night Live and The Land of Gorch, and was thankful that by the end of the year he and Henson were able to move on to The Muppet Show.
The Shadows No. 2	The Shadows No. 2 is an extended play 45 rpm record released in 1961 by The Shadows. It was released on Columbia Records/EMI as SEG 8148 in monaural and reached #12 in the United Kingdom EP charts in January, 1962. All the songs on the record had previously been released on the album The Shadows (album), and more songs from the album were to be released on the EP The Shadows No. 3. There appears never to have been a The Shadows No. 1. The liner notes were written by Cliff Richard.
The Spirit of the Laws	The Spirit of the Laws (French: De l'esprit des lois, originally spelled De l'esprit des loix; also sometimes translated The Spirit of Laws) is a book published in 1748 by Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. It is a book about law, comparing different ideas. The Books published by Montesquieu were subject to censorship. For this reason, the book was published anonymously, at first. The work was rapidly translated to other languages. In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation. In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added De l'esprit des lois to its Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). Yet Montesquieu's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others, most notably: Catherine the Great, who produced Nakaz (Instruction); the Founding Fathers of the United States#Constitutional Convention delegates of the United States Constitution; and Alexis de Tocqueville, who applied Montesquieu's methods to a study of American society, in Democracy in America. Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay offers us a hint of Montesquieu's importance when he writes in his 1827 essay entitled "Machiavelli" that "Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe." Montesquieu spent around twenty one years researching and writing De l'esprit des lois, covering many topics including law, social life and the study of anthropology, and providing more than 3,000 commendations. In this treatise Montesquieu argued that political institutions needed, for their success, to reflect the social and geographical aspects of the particular community. He pleaded for a Constitution with separation of powers, the preservation of legality and civil liberties, and the Abolitionism.<ref name=Cohleretal/>
The Truman Show delusion	The Truman Show delusion is a delusion some people have. It is named after The Truman Show, a movie from 1998. In the movie, the main character discovers that he is living in a constructed reality that is shown on television. All people except the main character of the movie are paid actors. People with this disorder have delusions about being followed. The may also think that they are famous. As of 2012, there were over forty reported cases of this delusion, in the United States and the United Kingdom. One of the patients, an upper-middle class Army veteran who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty in the belief that doing so would release him from the "show", described his condition this way:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog	"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is an English-language pangram. This is a sentence (linguistics) that contains all of the letters of the alphabet. The "quick brown fox" is commonly used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters and computer keyboards, and displaying examples of fonts. It can be used when all the letters in the alphabet need to be shown. Because it is a short sentence which makes sense it has become widely known.
Theobromine	Theobromine is a chemical substance, also known as xantheose. It is an alkaloid. It occurs in the cacao plant. Chemically, it is very similar to caffeine. with the suffix given to alkaloids and other Base (chemistry) nitrogen-containing compounds. Theobromine is a water-solubility, crystalline, bitter powder. Its colour is listed as either white or colourless. It has a similar, but lesser, effect to caffeine, making it a lesser homologous series . Theobromine is an isomer of theophylline as well as paraxanthine. Theobromine is categorized as a methyl xanthine, which means it is a xanthine with two methyl groups. Theobromine was first isolated from the seeds of the cacao tree in 1878 and then shortly afterwards was synthesized from xanthine by Hermann Emil Fischer. Theobromine is toxic to dogs.
Theorema egregium	Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin for "Remarkable Theorem") is a major result of differential geometry proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The theorem is about the curvature of Surface. The theorem states that curvature can be determined by measuring angles, distances and their rates on a surface alone. There is no need to talk about the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the surrounding three-dimensional Euclidean space. In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it. Gauss presented the theorem in this manner (translated from Latin):
Theoretical chemistry	Theoretical chemistry tries to explain Information from chemistry experiments. It uses mathematics and computers. Theoretical chemistry predicts what happens when atoms combine to form molecules. It also predicts chemical property (characteristics) of molecules. An important part of theoretical chemistry is quantum chemistry. This is using quantum mechanics to understand valence (chemistry) (the number of Chemical bond formed by an atom of an Chemical element). Other important parts include molecular dynamics, statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions, reaction networks, polymerization and catalyst.
Theory of multiple intelligences	Howard Gardner is a professor at Harvard University. His idea is that people are not smart in only one way. He says that we can be smart in many different ways.
Thermal decomposition	Thermal decomposition is a process that causes a chemical compound to into r chemical compounds or chemical elements under heat.
Thermite	Thermite is an mixture. It is not an explosive material, but can burn very fast and very hot. It is made of an oxide of a less chemical reactivity metal mixed with a more reactive metal. One of the most common mixtures is iron(III) oxide-aluminium. The iron(III) oxide oxidation the aluminium, being reduction (chemistry) to iron in the process. The aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide. Many other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite. Some metals that can be used are boron, magnesium, calcium, titanium, zinc, or silicon. Some metal oxides that can be used are copper(II) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, silicon dioxide, boron trioxide, or lead(II,IV) oxide. A metal cannot be used with its metal oxide. The metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide, or the thermite will not work.
Thesaurus	A thesaurus is a dictionary of synonyms (words that have the same or similar meaning). Thesauruses (or thesauri) often include related words that mean almost the same thing. Some thesauruses also include antonyms (words that have the opposite meaning). For example, by looking up the word "big" in a thesaurus, someone would find a list of other similar words such as "huge" and "massive". If the thesaurus also has a list of antonyms, the user could also find words which mean the opposite, like "small" and "tiny". Many students and writers use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are writing. Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their vocabulary (the number of words that they know).
Thougal Jagoi	"Thougal Jagoi" () (literally, "Dance of dedication") or "Jagoi Ashangbi" () is a Meitei traditional dance form, performed by men and women, along with maibis (priestesses) to invoke the deities. It is performed in the religious festival of Lai Haraoba. The performance lasts for half an hour, after which the "Hoi Lauba" ceremony is enacted.
Threat	A threat is basically a declaration of intent to inflict punishment or harm or loss on another. However, in many cases the threat is not believed, or may even be a joke. Like other communications a threat has a context, and the context decides its meaning. A child who says "I'll tell my dad" may learn from the reply "I'm so scared!" that the threat is an idle threat: one that is promises harm that cannot or will not actually be inflicted. To encourage compliance, a threat to do harm may be mixed with an offer to do good, conditional upon what the recipient does. This is sometimes called a throffer. The threat part may be implied, yet effective. Some countries, such as the United States, have a legal concept of true threat. A true threat is a threatening communication which can be prosecuted under the law. A threat can describe a situation of danger: for example "a terrorist threat". Many countries have a system where the government can adjust its security by having official threat levels.
Three-body problem	The three-body problem is a problem in the field of physics that physicists find interesting. The goal is to find how three things move when they attract each other with gravity. It would be for instance the problem of the movement of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. Physicists do not have a general solution that always works.
Three-phase electric power	Three-phase electric power is a method to generate, transmit and distribute Alternating current. It is the most common method in power systems to transfer power from Electricity generation to Electrical load. Three-phase systems are usually more economical to be used than equivalent Single-phase electric power or Double-phase electric power systems.
Tiffany lamp	A Tiffany lamp is a type of lamp (fixture) with a glass shade. They are made with glass designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his design studio, Tiffany & Co.. The most famous was the stained Came glasswork lamp. Tiffany lamps are considered part of the Art Nouveau movement. Due to Tiffany's dominant influence on the style, the term 'Tiffany lamp' or 'Tiffany style lamp' often refers to stained leaded glass lamps. Even those not made by Louis Comfort Tiffany's company.
Tights	Tights are a tight fitting clothing. In American English, the term includes pantyhose. They usually fit from the waist down and are often worn in dancing. Tights in the past were made of elasticized silk or other material. Modern tights are often made of spandex. Tights were invented in 1598, by a man called William Lee. He was a reverend and made a machine that knitted together silk. Tights come in thin and thick options. Thinner tights are called sheer and thicker ones are called opaque. People measure this thickness uses something called "denier". They are five categories that show what denier a pair of tights is: Ultra sheer, sheer, semi-opaque, opaque and thick-opaque. Tights are intended to maintain a wearer’s legs warm, and they arrive in a vast collection of colors, lengths, and materials. Tights come in a diverse selection of colors and patterns. 1 rule of thumb to consider is that coated leggings like the shiny metallic leggings will usually have less stretch than faux leather leggings or even our basic nylon leggings which are the absolute most easy to fit due to their unhindered stretch. <gallery>File:Renaissance-tights.jpg|Renaissance-era costumeFile:Supporting breast cancer research (2907275545).jpg|Footless tights under a skirt </gallery>
Tillage	Tillage is the process in which soil is loosened and softened by tillers or harrows pulled by a tractor or by a plough pulled by an animal or human. The plough breaks the upper crust of the soil so that air and sunlight enter into the soil. This makes the soil more fertile but too much or frequent tillage may make it less fertile.
Tokusatsu	Tokusatsu is a Japanese language word that means "special effects". It is used to talk about television shows and movies that have superheros, giant monsters, and other science fiction and fantasy themes. Some famous tokusatsu features include Godzilla, Kamen Rider, and Super Sentai.
Tomason	A , also spelled Thomason and Thomasson in English, is a kind of conceptual art or found art. Gempei Akasegawa created this word to describe certain kinds of useless parts of buildings or roads. These have lost their purpose as the environment around them changed. This kind of art is not made on purpose, but becomes art when people and it.
Tone	A musical tone is a repeating sound. Musical tones are different in duration, loudness, and timbre. The notes used in music can have many complex forms, such as short transient, vibrato, and shifts in noise. A simple tone, or pure tone, has a steady noise. A complex tone is a musical tone that is not steady. Simple tones are added together to make complex tones.<ref></ref>
Topological space	A topological space is a space studied in topology, the mathematics of the structure of shapes. Roughly, it is a set of things (called points) along with a way to know which things are close together. More precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called Open set. Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points near another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as any set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.We also have the concept of closed sets, which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set. Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The Union (set theory) of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then every set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed. The set containing no points is also both open and closed. A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces.
Topology	Topology is an area of Mathematics, which studies how spaces are organized and how they are structured in terms of position. It also studies how spaces are connected. It is divided into algebraic topology, differential topology and geometric topology. Topology has been called rubber-sheet geometry. In a topology of two dimensions there is no difference between a circle and a square. A circle made out of a rubber band can be stretched into a square. There is a difference between a circle and a figure eight. A figure eight cannot be stretched into a circle without tearing. The spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces. They vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions.
Tor (software)	Tor is a group of computer server that keep users secret on the Internet. It works by moving Information across many Tor servers, called "hops". The role of each server is to only move that data to another server. With the final hop moving data to the end site. As a result, information transmitted in this way is hard to trace. Tor is also the name that some people give to the web browser used to access the Tor server, the Tor Browser Bundle. The browser is actually a specific version of Mozilla Firefox that has been changed so that it is extremely safe and secure.
Traction motor	Traction motor refers to a type of electric motor. A traction motor is used to make rotation torque on a machine. It is usually changed into a straight line motion. Traction motors are used in Electricity powered rail vehicles such as electric multiple units and electric locomotives. They are also used in electric vehicles, such as electric milk floats, elevators, and conveyors. Vehicles with electrical transmission systems such as Diesel-electric locomotives, electric hybrid vehicles and battery powered electric vehicles.
Trait theory	In psychology, trait theory is a the study of human personality psychology. Trait theorists are interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as patterns of behaviour, thought, and emotion.<ref>Saul Kassin (2003). Psychology. USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc.</ref>
Trance	Trance describes a state of mind. A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her. The term trance is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow (psychology), religion, and certain kinds of music. It is an "altered state of consciousness". There are many efforts to define what a trance is. Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information. Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called "dissociation". Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream. There are many examples of trance in religion. African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. States of "spiritual ecstasy" are known in most forms of Christian worship. It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as "mysticism".
Transformation	In mathematics, a transformation is a rule that describes relations between two different coordinate systems and points in them. Some examples are Translation (geometry), Dilation (geometry), rotation, reflection, shear mapping, point reflection, and circle inversion. Any of transformations is also a transformation.
Transformer	A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another through mutual (electromagnetic induction) and without change in frequency. Transformers are an important part of electrical systems. Transformers are made in many different sizes, from a very small coupling transformer inside a stage microphone to big units that carry hundreds of MVA used in power grids. The main reason to use a transformer is to make power of one voltage level into power of another voltage level. High voltage is easier to send a long distance, but less voltage is easier and safer to use in the office or home.Transformers are used to increase or decrease alternating current (AC) voltage in circuits. The transformer is usually built with two coils around the same core. The primary coil or input coil is connected to supply side while secondary coil supplies power to load. The second one is called the output coil. Energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary by electromagnetism. In power grids many transformers are used. These are networks for delivering electricity from the generator and to the user. The transformers in your neighborhood, on electricity poles, or the ones connected to underground wires, usually transform high voltage of 7,200 volts to 220-240 volts of electricity to power lights and appliances such as refrigerators in homes and businesses. Some countries, such as United States of America use different voltages in homes, such as 120 volts. Transformers cannot increase Power (physics), so if the voltage is raised, the Electric current is proportionally lowered. If the voltage is lowered, the current is proportionally increased. Transformers inside electronics equipment provide the kinds of electricity the various parts need. There are several basic types of transformers:
Translation	Translation means to copy writing or speech from one language into a different language. The people who do translation are called translators. A translator who is copying a book into another language may use a language dictionary to find out how a word is written in another language. A translator who works with the spoken word is also called an interpreter. Translators can work independently as freelancers or by being hired by translation agencies. People translate poetry, novels, drama, or short stories are called literary translators. In computer technology, translation from a programming language to a machine language is called compile. There are free translators on the internet.
Translation (geometry)	In geometry, a translation is a transformation that moves everything by the same distance in the same direction. It does not change size or shape.
Translator	A translator reads something written in one language and speaks it or writes it in another language. For example, they could read a book in French language and then translate it into English. See translation for more information. In order to convert meanings from one language into another one, translators must be able to know the target language deeply. They are conveying the original meaning of the source text or material to the second language. As a result, translators do not only convert words, which makes it more like an art than a science.
Transliteration	Transliteration is a conversion of a text from one script to another. It swaps letter (alphabet) (thus + ) in predictable ways (such as alpha → a, de (Cyrillic) → d, chi (letter) → ch, ն → n or æ → ae. Transliteration is not about the phonetics of the original. It is about the typeface or written characters, mostly the letters. Example: the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, "", is usually transliterated as "Rossiya".So, 'сс' is transliterated as 'ss', but pronounced /s/. Transliteration typically goes grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling. Transliteration is opposed to transcription (linguistics), which maps the sounds of one language into a writing system.
Transmutation	Transmutation is a basic process in alchemy. The most important form of transmutation is the change of lead into gold. Alchemists tried and failed to change base metals (metals of very little value) into a metal of high value like gold. However, more recent work by James Chadwick and Irène Joliot-Curie in nuclear physics has established that radioactivity does lead to elemental changes. [[category:Physics]][[category:Occult]]
Transonic	Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound (1,236 kph or 768 mph). The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed.
Transport Layer Security	Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide security and data integrity for communications over Internet Protocol Suite networks such as the Internet. Several versions of the protocols are common in applications such as web browsing, e-mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging and Voice over Internet Protocol.
Transposition (music)	Transposition or transposing in music means playing or writing music in a way that makes it sound higher or lower. This can be done by playing or writing the music in a different key (music), or by playing or writing it up or down an octave, without changing the key. Transposing is a useful skill for people who play an musical instrument, especially the piano, Organ (music), or some other keyboard instrument. If a pianist is accompaniment (music) a singer and the song is a little too high for the singer’s voice, it is very useful if he is able to transpose it down so that the music sounds in a lower key. For example, if the music is written in the key of C major, it could be transposed down a whole tone so that it sounds in B-flat major. Most electronic keyboards and organs these days have buttons which can set notes to transpose automatically. This can be very useful, although it may be confusing for people with absolute pitch.
Travel website	A travel website is a website that is similiar to a Guide book printed as a book. Travel websites show Review on places, or what to do in a place. 70% of travellers use travel websites. Wikivoyage is an example of a travel website.
TraxWeekly	TraxWeekly was one of the main IBM PC demoscene e-zines (electronic magazines) of 1990s. The other one was DemoNews.TraxWeekly only focused on music and used to be the most important source of news on Tracker (music software) music and major releases in the music industry. It ran for 119 issues from March 12, 1995 to February 16, 1998. When it ended, over eleven hundred subscribers were getting it. It used a strong format that included interviews, reviews, and on-the-spot reports from major demo party from all over the world. After it ended, it was largely replaced by Static Line (magazine), another e-zine, which was created by Coplan/SceneSpot.
Treasury	The Treasury is the government’s economic and finance ministry, maintaining control over public spending, setting the direction of the UK’s economic policy and working to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth.
Tree line	The tree-line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow. Beyond the tree-line, they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad. There are several types of tree lines defined in ecology and geology:
Trench coat	A trench coat (or trenchcoat) is a type of outdoor clothing. Trenchcoats are long coats made from stiff material, like heavy-duty cotton. They were invented for soldiers to wear in World War I to keep them warm. Most trench coats also protect the wearer against rain.
Trial and error	Trial and error is a primitive method of solving problems. It is characterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success, or until the agent stops trying. It is an unsystematic method, which does not employ insight, theory or organised methodology. According to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan after trying out similar phrases "trial and failure" and "trial and practice". Under Morgan's canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it. Edward Thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning. He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning.
Trial in absentia	Trial in absentia (literally in absence in the Latin language) means a person is held responsible for a crime and trial although he or she is not present during the proceedings. It may be because the person is at an unknown location or has escaped justice, for example after paying bail and then refused to return to the court on the date set anyway, or because the person may not be even alive (a famous case is Martin Bormann, who most likely died in May 1945 and was sentenced to death in November 1946, as part of the Nuremberg Trials). It is controversial, especially if a person is convicted and sentenced to a hard punishment, because the basic premise of a trial is thus violated, and everyone has a right to defend oneself. Others point out, however, that this right is waived when one doesn't show up without a good reason and that the court must make its best, through appointing a defender for instance, to determine guilt or innocence even if the person is not present. Most defendants make their case through a defender anyway, especially when the crime is serious. Another case is when a court or committee must determine whether a person, such as a suspected terrorist, is going to be surveillance or wire-tapped, and whether there is enough suspicion of criminal activity or intent to do so. In that case, the person himself can of course not be asked to appear, as the idea is to hold the surveillance secret. In that case, a defender is appointed to make the case that the suspected person does not want to and does not deserve to be subjected to surveillance and that it should not be permitted, although he/she doesn't know of the proceedings. Most of such hearings, however, are not a trial in the technical sense of the term, though they may involve a judge and lawyer and so on.
Trialware	Trialware is one type of shareware. It is software that the user can only use for a short time. Then it expires. If the person wishes to keep using the program, he or she must buy a registration key or password. Trialware may be set up by date or days. For example, a 30-day trialware program may expire in 30 days or after it has been used for 30 non-contiguous days. Also called "demoware," sophisticated trialware prevents a user from installing new trial versions over and over without paying. For example, it can look for a hidden file or an entry in the Windows Registry that it created when it was previously installed. See shareware and wares.
Triangle center	In geometry, a triangle center is a Point (geometry) that can be called the middle of a triangle. There are many ways of measuring the center of a triangle, and each has a different name. On an equilateral triangle, every triangle center is the same, but on other triangles, the centers are different. Triangle centers may be inside or outside the triangle. Today, mathematicians have discovered over 40,000 triangle centers. They are listed in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, which is run by Clark Kimberling at the University of Evansville.
Triclinic	A triclinic crystal is shaped almost like a rectangle. It is slightly bent, though. Copper sulfate makes triclinic crystals. It is the least symmetric (meaning that both sides are not very similar). . In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system.
Trier of fact	In a criminal trial the trier of fact, also called the finder of fact, is the person or persons responsible for deciding the factual issues. This is also called a finding of fact. In a jury trial the trier of fact is the jury. Trier of fact is now considered an older term. The term "finder of fact" has come into use more recently. Once the trier of fact determines what is assumed to be the truth of a matter, then Law are applied to those facts. A judge instructs a jury about the legal rules applying to the Legal case. These s include what the findings may be.<ref name=Best3/> For example the jury may find for the plantiff or the jury may find for the defendant.<ref name=Best3/>
Triple DES	In cryptography, Triple DES is a block cipher created from the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher by using it three times. Triple DES is also known as TDES or, more standard, TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm ). When it was discovered that a 56-bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attacks, TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm. The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet-in-the-middle attacks that are effective against double DES encryption. In general TDES with three different keys (3-key TDES) has a Key size of 168 bits: three 56-bit DES key (cryptography)s (with parity bits 3-key TDES has the total storage length of 192 bits), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits. Another version, called two-key TDES (2-key TDES), uses k1 = k3, thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits. However, this mode can be taken advantage of through certain Chosen-plaintext attack or Known-plaintext attack attacks and so TDES is treated by National Institute of Standards and Technology to have only 80 bits of security. By design, DES and therefore TDES, suffer from slow performance in software. TDES is better suited to hardware implementations,<ref name="softwareSlow" /> which are many of the places it is still used. TDES is slowly disappearing from use, largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One large-scale exception is within the electronic payments industry, which still uses 2TDES extensively and continues to develop and spread standards based upon it (e.g. EMV, the standard for inter-operation of IC cards; also called "Chip cards", and IC capable POS terminals and Automated teller machine). This guarantees that TDES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future.
Triple point	The triple point of any substance is the combination of temperature and pressure at which it exists in its solid, liquid, and gaseous state all at once, in equilibrium. The temperature of the triple point of water is a commonly used physical constant which is used to define temperature scales and calibrate temperature-measuring systems. By definition, the temperature of the triple point of water is 273.16 Kelvin, or 0.01 °C. One degree Celsius is defined as 1/273.16th part of the triple point of water. This fixes the temperature scale as defined in the ITS 90, which is the international temperature scale of 1990. This scale is developed as a practical approximation of the thermodynamics temperature scale.
Triptych	A triptych is a series of three separate paintings that together form a story. The word comes from the Greek language adjective triptukhon (three-fold), from tri, (three) and ptysso, (to fold) or ptyx, (fold) The paintings are usually joined together, with hinges, so that they can be folded shut or displayed open. The middle painting is usually larger, although they can be of equal size. A triptych is usually an art work, but the word can be used for anything in three parts which join together to make a single item.
Triskaidekaphobia	Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of the number thirteen. The number 13 has been linked to bad luck in the western superstition. Buildings in the United States does not have the "13th floor". The term was first used by Isador Coriat in Abnormal Psychology. There is also a fear of Friday the 13th. This fear is called paraskevidekatriaphobia or friggatriskaidekaphobia. 13 is not unlucky. People have no reason to fear it.
Trolley problem	The trolley problem is an thought experiment that people can solve to explore how the human mind works. Most people think that the trolley problem was invented by Oxford University philosophy professor Philippa Foot in the 1960s, but it might have been someone else. Foot wrote about the trolley problem and other problems in her 1967 essay "The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect." Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Judith Jarvis Thomson made the trolley problem famous. Now many schools teach the trolley problem. For a while, there was even a part of philosophy called trolleyology. Jarvis Thomson named the problem "the trolley problem." The trolley problem does not have a right or wrong answer. Instead, it is a way to make people think and talk about what makes actions good or bad and why.
Trophallaxis	Trophallaxis in biology refers the sharing of food by members of a community. It is most highly developed in social insects such as ants, termites, wasps and bees. The word was introduced by the entomology William Morton Wheeler in 1918. The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects. The French psychologist and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society. He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book The social world of the ants compared with that of man. Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees and ants. In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the Colony (biology) odour that identifies members.<ref>Dahbi A. Hefetz A. Cerda X. and Lenoir A. 1999. Trophallaxis mediates uniformity of colony odor in Cataglyphis iberica ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)Journal of Insect Behavior. 12(4):559-567 abstract </ref>
Trophic state index	The trophic state index (TSI) is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in a lake, or other body of water. Nutrients increase plant growth, and raise the trophic levels. The TSI can be used to make an estimate of the biological condition of a lake.
Tropical climate	A tropical climate is a type of climate typical in the tropics. It is a damp climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures above 18°C (64.4 °F).Some tropical areas have rainfall throughout the year, usually in the afternoon. Others have a wet season and a dry season, for example because of monsoon. The Tropical climate is humid and wet. One famous area of tropical climate is the Amazon rainforest. A few places near the equator, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, are high mountains and cold for that reason.
True name	A true name is a name of a thing or being that expresses, or is somehow identical with, its true nature. The idea that language, or some specific sacred language, refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophy and grammar study as well as various traditions of magic, divination and mysticism since ancient times.
Truncated differential cryptanalysis	In cryptography, truncated differential cryptanalysis is a generalization of differential cryptanalysis, an attack model against block ciphers. In 1994 Lars Knudsen designed the technique, during this period ordinary differential cryptanalysis Analysis the full difference between two texts, the truncated version considers differences that are only determined to some extent. It has been applied to SAFER, International Data Encryption Algorithm, Skipjack (cipher), E2 (cipher), Twofish, Camellia (cipher), CRYPTON, and the stream cipher Salsa20 as well.
Trust law	In law a trust is a where property is held by one for the of another party. A trust is created by the owner, also called a "settlor", "trustor" or "grantor" who s property to a trustee. The trustee holds that property for the trust's Beneficiary. They have existed since Ancient Rome times.
Trusted third party	In cryptography, a trusted third party (TTP) is an entity which makes interactions between two parties easy. Both parties must trust the third party; they use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are commonly used by cryptosystems.
Tuckman's stages of group development	Tuckman's stages of group development is a model of group development made by Bruce Tuckman in 1965. It has four phases: Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing.
Tuition payments	Tuition payments, usually known as tuition in American English and as tuition fees in English in the Commonwealth of Nations, are fees charged for students looking for a higher education. Tuition payments are charged by colleges and universities include costs for lab equipment, computer systems, libraries, facility upkeep and to provide a comfortable student learning experience.
Tuning fork	A tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork. The prongs, called tines, are made from a U-shaped bar of metal (usually steel). This bar of metal can move freely. It resonance at a specific constant pitch (music) when set vibrate by striking it against an object. It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out. The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs. Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments, and in some tests of hearing.
Turbojet	A turbojet is a kind of jet engine that works by squeezing air into a small space, mixing it with fuel, and setting it on fire. The mixture of fuel and air goes out the back of the engine and pushes it forward. As it leaves the engine it spins a turbine which turns a gas compressor at the front which sucks in more air and compresses it. Turbofan engines are more complex. They are more common today because they can make more Power (physics) for the same amount of fuel than a turbojet.<ref name=Mair77.78/> They also make less noise. Supersonic aircraft still use the simpler kind.
Tuxedo	A tuxedo is an ensemble (or outfit) of clothing which includes a white dress shirt, a bow tie, dress pants, a tuxedo suit jacket (sometimes called a dinner jacket), leather dress shoes, and sometimes a vest or cummerbund, top hat and gloves. In European countries, this outfit is called black tie. Many men wear this outfit in Western countries on formal occasions like a marriage ceremony or a fancy party or dance. The white dress shirt is usually made of cotton or linen. A dress shirt has a stiff collar and it is ironed before it is worn. A bow tie is usually made of silk or polyester, and it is usually black or white. Dress pants are made of wool or polyester, and they are ironed before they are worn. A tuxedo suit jacket is usually made of wool or polyester. Suit jackets have a collar, pockets, and a silk or polyester lining. Leather dress shoes are usually made of dark-colored leather which is polished. Sometimes, a person wearing a tuxedo will also wear a sleeveless vest with buttons in the front, a black top hat, and white gloves. Some men wear a tuxedo for their jobs, such as symphony orchestra musicians or waiters in expensive restaurants. Since most men do not wear tuxedos very often, they rent them when needed instead of buying them. Sometimes, men's tuxedo vests and ties match the dress of the woman he is with. They are mainly worn to big events such as weddings, dinner parties or some sort of smart dressed do.
Twofish	In cryptography, Twofish is a Symmetric-key algorithm block cipher with a block size (cryptography) of 128 bits and Key size up to 256 bits. In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced for competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard, Twofish was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition, but was not selected as a standard. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish (cipher). Twofish's main features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent Substitution box, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish uses some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish uses the same Feistel network as the Data Encryption Standard. On most software platforms Twofish is slightly slower than Rijndael key schedule (the chosen algorithm for Advanced Encryption Standard) for 128-bit key (cryptography), but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys.<ref name="paper-aes-comparison"></ref>
Typographical error	A typographical error or typo is a word that has been spelt wrong by accident. There are a few ways to make a typo:
UBS	UBS AG is a Switzerland finance company. It is an investment bank. 60,000 people work with them in total around the world. The headquarters are in Zürich.
US Airways Flight 1549	US Airways Flight 1549 was an airplane flight that landed in the Hudson River in New York City on January 15, 2009. The plane was on a Commercial aviation with 155 people on board and had left LaGuardia Airport six minutes earlier, but it had to land after a flock of birds hit its engines. The event was remarkable because no one died. Because of this, the event was called the Miracle on the Hudson. In 2016 a film was made recreating the crash. The film is named Sully (film), after the plane's main pilot Chesley Sullenberger. The plane took off from LaGuardia Airport at 3:26 pm. It was going to fly to Charlotte, North Carolina, North Carolina, and then it would fly onwards to Seattle, Washington (state). Two minutes after the plane left the ground, it flew into a flock of Canada goose. Some of the geese were sucked into the plane's two engines. Both engines stopped working. The pilots, Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles, realized that they needed to land the plane as soon as possible. They thought about heading back to LaGuardia Airport or trying to land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. They decided that they could not land at an airport and instead they would have to land the plane in the river. This was also dangerous for two reasons. Firstly, the plane would break apart if it hit the water too quickly or if it hit something else. Secondly, the passengers would drown if they were not rescued quickly, as it would be hard to swim in the cold river. The pilots landed the plane in the river at 3:31 pm. The plane started to slowly fill with water and sink. The passengers climbed out onto the wings and Evacuation slide of the plane. Sullenberger had landed the plane near some boats, and the first boats reached the plane a few minutes after the landing. The boats rescued the passengers and crew. By 3:55 pm, everyone had been rescued. They were taken to both sides of the river. 24 passengers and two rescuers had to go to a hospital, but most of them left the hospitals before the end of the day. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the event. In May 2010, they released a report which said that Sullenberger had made the right decision. The plane is now on display in the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte.
Ubuntu Studio	Ubuntu Studio is an officially recognized derivative of the Ubuntu (operating system) Linux distribution that focuses on audio, video and graphics production. The original version, based on Ubuntu 7.04, was released on May 10, 2007.
Ultra	Ultra was the name given by United Kingdom military intelligence for the attack on Third Reich military codes in World War II. It included the Enigma machine and, later, the Japanese Purple machine. The work on Enigma started before the war, when Polish cryptography smuggled out an Enigma machine to England. The codename 'Ultra', however, was only given to the work in 1941. Work on understanding the Enigma, and on breaking German military signals, was of vital importance in the Battle of the Atlantic, the greatest threat to Britain during the war. The key event occurred in 1941, when not just a machine, but also a codebook, was got from a German submarine. Wartime signals intelligence (SIGINT) were got as follows. First of all, encryption German radio messages in Morse code were recorded in Britain. Their place of origin was got by recording the messages at two different receiving places. The attack on the codes was done at the Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. Ultra became the standard term among the western Allies of World War II for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence got was thought more important than the highest British Classified information (Most Secret).
Unicode	Unicode is a standard for character encoding computer text in most of the internationally used writing systems into bytes. It is promoted by the Unicode Consortium and based on International Organization for Standardization standards. Its goal is to replace current and previous character encoding standards with one worldwide standard for all languages. New versions are issued every few years and later versions have over 100,000 characters. Unicode was developed in the 1990s and integrated earlier codes used on computer systems. Unicode provides many printable characters, such as letters, digits, diacritics (things that attach to letters), and punctuation marks. It also provides characters which do not actually print, but instead control how text is processed. For example, a Newline and a character that makes text go from right to left are both characters that do not print. Unicode considers a graphical character (for instance é) as a code point (alone or in sequence [e+ ‘] ). Each code point is a number with many digits which can be encoded in one or several code units. Code units are 8, 16, or 32 bits. This allows Unicode to represent characters in binary.
Uniform Resource Identifier	In computing, a Uniform Resource Identifier is something used to name something on the Internet. URIs are similar to URLs, because they are the name of something. Examples of URIs include:
Uniform Resource Locator	Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is another name for a web address. URLs are made of letters, numbers and other symbols in a standard form. People use them on computers, to make the computer fetch and show some specific resource (usually a web page) from another computer (server) on the Internet. They do this by typing the URL into a web browser, or more often clicking a link, for example one on a web page that they are already seeing. URLs consist of several parts:
Uninterruptible power supply	An uninterruptible power supply (or uninterruptible power source; UPS) is an apparatus that provides electric power in an emergency when there is a problem with the normal electricity supply. It provides an almost supply of electricity during any power failure. It is used normally to protect any sensitive Computer hardware (computer, data center, telecommunication) in which if there is any disruption of power supply, it might easily damage that equipment. UPS batteries are Lead acid battery that use gel sulfuric acid instead of the liquid sulfuric acid car batteries use. UPS batteries are sealed and have the property to store electricity and provide a consistent high surge Direct_current to a UPS system which converts it to a stabilized Alternating_current. UPS batteries have a wide selection of dimensions and one of their main properties is that they do not leak or produce fumes. This is one of the most important reasons why they are used safely in houses, server rooms, data centers, manufacturing environments, hospitals, offices, and other poorly ventilated areas. These sealed lead-acid batteries can be found in some of the electronics stores or UPS specialized stores.
Union Carbide	Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical. It currently employs more than 2,400 people. Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster. Founded in 1917 as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready Battery Company and Energizer Holdings batteries, Glad (company) bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.
Union List of Artist Names	The Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) is an online database containing the names, alternative names, and biographies of visual artists and architects. It also contains other information such their patrons, and the subjects of portraits they have created. The ULAN is run by the Getty Research Institute. The institute began developing the database in 1984.
Union of Azerbaijani Writers	The Union of Azerbaijani Writers () is the largest [[:wikt:public|public]] organization of Azerbaijani writers, poets and [[:wikt:publicist|publicists]]. It has over 1500 members at present. It was founded on June 13, 1934. At this time Azerbaijan was a part of the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. It is currently chaired by the writer Anar Rzayev since 1987.<ref name=azyb/> He is the son of writer Rasul Rza. Rza was the chairman between 1938–1939.<ref name=azyb/>
Unit load device	A unit load device, or ULD, (ULD) is a pallet or a Containerization. It is used to load luggage, freight, and mail on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled into a single unit. As with other cargo transport, this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or manifest) so that its contents can be tracked.
United States Statutes at Large	The United States Statutes at Large, commonly referred to as the Statutes at Large and Abbreviation Stat., is the official record of Act of Congress and concurrent resolutions passed by the United States Congress. Each act and resolution of Congress is called a slip law, which is classified as either Public bill (abbreviated Pub.L.) or Private bill (Pvt.L.), and designated and numbered accordingly. At the end of a Congress session, slip laws (now commonly called session laws) are compiled into Statutes at Large, which are numbered and organised by Congress session. They are part of a three-part model for publication of Statutes consisting of slip laws, session laws (Statutes at Large), and Codification (law) (United States Code).
Universal indicator	A universal indicator is a test to measure the pH value of a liquid. The solution that is used has several chemical indicators in it. This means that the indicator is able to show different colours (and therefore pH value ranges). The drawback of this solution is that it cannot be used for titrations, which expect a well-defined change in color.
Upland and lowland	Upland and lowland are terms used in ecology, physical geography and geology. They describe the relative height of land above sea level. Uplands have rivers and streams which are fast-flowing, clear, and with plenty of oxygen. They drain high or mountainous country, and go down into broad plains (where they become lowland rivers. Lowlands usually have warmer, slow-flowing waters carrying lots of sediment and with poor oxygen content. Upland rivers run fast and cut through rock (Colorado River). Lowland rivers meander slowly towards the coast (Mississippi River). They carry lots of soil and are a dark colour. Therefore the fish and other animals which live in the river are quite different according to the two stages or types of river. The terms also apply to large areas of land. Because mountain-building (orogeny) lifts up huge sections of the Earth, there are large areas which are well above sea level: the highlands. But on the trailing edge of a continent, the land is low. So the Americas are (broadly speaking) high on the west (the American Cordillera) and low on the east (Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata). This is a consequence of plate tectonics, as the Americas have moved slowly west for over 100 million years. The Appalachians are a far older chain of ground-down mountains carried along by the continent as it moved west. The same pattern can be seen in other continents, especially with great rivers such as the Congo River and the Indus River. Australia is the exception: its mountain ranges are very ancient and worn down. Recent plate tectonics there has not been so significant as elsewhere.
Urchin barren	Urchin barrens are places in the ocean where sea urchins have eaten and killed so many kelp plants that they turned a kelp forest into something like a desert. This happens when there are too many sea urchins. The fish, krill and other animals that live in the kelp either die or leave. Urchin barrens occur in coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean. Urchin barrens had been forming for a long time, but in the second half of the 2010s, there were suddenly many more.<ref name="GuardianPurple"/>
Uses and gratifications theory	The Uses and gratifications theory is a theory by Blumer and Katz. It states that different people watch television and movies for different reasons. There may be somebody who will watch a romantic comedy so that they can put themselves in the shoes of the characters and feel love. Somebody may watch Breaking Bad so that they can join in with social conversation relating to that topic. It may be said that you would watch a television for escapism so that you forget the stress or normal life.
Utility frequency	Utility frequency, line frequency or mains frequency is the frequency level of the alternating current electricity used in transmission and distribution from electricity generation sources to customers. The world's two major utility frequencies are 50 Hertz (most, but not all, of the Eastern hemisphere) and 60 Hz (most, but not all, of the Western hemisphere). Many Railway electrification system in Europe use a frequency of 16.7 Hz (one third of 50 Hz). Early electric railways sometimes used 25 Hz (half of 50 Hz). New electric railways usually use the standard mains frequency of 50 Hz. Some lines in the northeast United States still use 25 Hz.
V-chip	The V-chip is a technology. It is used in television set receivers in the United States, Canada and Brazil. It allows blocking of certain television programs or movies based under their category. Televisions manufacturing since January 2000 are required to have the V-chip technology. The V-chip is for content reasons, like sex, profanity and violence.
VMware ThinApp	VMware ThinApp is a computer program that can make portable applications.
VSCO	VSCO is a Photography application for Smartphone. It was developed by Joel Flory and Greg Lutze in 2011.
VSEPR theory	The shape of a molecule or ion is determined by the repulsion between the electron pairs surrounding the central atom. Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion Theory - Only the electron pairs arranged round the central atom in a covalent molecule need to be considered - Pairs of electrons repel each other and move as far apart as possible - Lone pair-lone pair repulsion is greater than lone pair-bonding pair repulsion which is greater than bonding pair- bonding pair repulsion - The actual shape of species is determined by the atoms attached round the central atom (and influenced by the lone pairs of electrons) - All bonds - single bonds, double bonds and triple bonds - take up the same space.
Value judgement	A value judgement (or value judgment) is an Judgement of the rightness or wrongness or usefulness of something. It is based on what a person thinks or prefers. Value judgments are not truth value. This is because they are not objectivity. They are decisions about how a person thinks or feels, or about what action a person thinks should be taken. They are opinions. A typical dictionary definition runs:
Van de Graaff Generator	A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic machine. It uses a moving, nonmetallic belt to accumulate very high voltages on a hollow metal globe. Voltage differences achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. Applications for these high voltage generators include driving X-ray tubes, accelerating electrons to sterilize food and process materials, and accelerating protons for Nuclear physics experiments. The Van de Graaff generator can be thought of as a constant-current source connected in parallel with a capacitor and a very large electrical resistance. It is named after the United States physicist Robert Jemison Van de Graaff, who built the first generators of this style in 1929.
Van der Waals radius	The Van der Waals radius is the radius of an atom that is seen as a hard sphere. It is named after someone who realized that atoms were not points, but actual objects. It can be found by the critical point and the physical properties of a gas. It also can be found by a molecular crystal.
Vanishing point	In art, a vanishing point is the point in a perspective (graphical) drawing where lines that either parallel to each other or are not to the main subject of the painting come together. At this point the two parallel lines seem to converge.It can be experienced in real life while seeing a parallel set of rails or the two parallel lines of a road , they appear to converge at a far away point.
Variable-frequency drive	A variable-frequency drive (VFD) is a device used to control the speed and torque of an Alternating current Electric motor by changing the motor input frequency and voltage.
Variation	Variation in biology usually refers to the heritable differences within a species. This is important in genetics, and the study of evolution in natural populations. Heritable variation is ultimately caused by mutations of genes and chromosomes, and shuffled by recombination. Outcrossing keeps, and inbreeding reduces, heritable variation. Other variations are caused during life, and are not passed on to the next generation by heredity. Variation is also a term used in biodiversity for the variety of life forms in a given ecosystem.
Vegetation	Vegetation means the plant life of a region or the plant community. It means all ground cover by plants, and is the main element of the biosphere. When you say vegetation you do not think of any species composition, life forms, structure, Space (physics) extent, "naturalness", or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. That is meant by Flora (plants) which refers exclusively to species composition. Vegetation can refer to a wide range of spatial scales. Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are meant by the term vegetation.
Vehicle registration plate	A vehicle registration plate is a metal or plastic plate on a vehicle or trailer. It is used for official identification purposes. There is a numeric or alphanumeric (meaning that the code is made up of numbers and letters) code that identifies the vehicle. In some countries, the identifier is unique in the entire country. In other countries, it is unique in a state or province. Sometimes the identifier is for a person and sometimes for a vehicle. Each country calls a vehicle registration plate something different. Some examples are license plate or tag (American English), licence plate (Canadian English), number plate or registration plate (British English).
Vehicle registration plates of Lithuania	Standard vehicle registration plates in Lithuania have three letters and three numbers (e.g. ABC 123) in black lettering on a white background. The plates are usually of the standard European Union dimensions, but can also be manufactured in the American size for imported vehicles. All plates issued before 2004 also have a blue EU identification stripe on their left-hand edge.
Verismo	Verismo is a word which refers to a type of literature and a type of opera that was popular towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The Italian language word "verismo" means "realism".In literature the main verismo writers were the France Émile Zola, the Norway dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the Italian writer Giovanni Verga. The composer Pietro Mascagni used a story by Verga for his opera Cavalleria rusticana. This was a short, one-act opera which became extremely popular. Several composers were inspired by it and wrote similar works. The only one of these which is still regularly performed is Pagliacci by Ruggero Leoncavallo. These two short operas are often performed on the same evening. They are known together as "Cav and Pag". Verismo operas are generally based on stories about ordinary people from the working classes rather than about kings or gods or aristocrats. There is often a lot of violence in the stories as people love one another with great passions, which often leads to murder. Bizet's opera Carmen is typical of that kind of story, although it was composed before the verismo tradition was really popular.
Vertex	A vertex is a corner. More than one vertex are called vertices. A vertex is a point where two or more lines, curves, rays, or sides meet, and is often represented by letters such as P, Q, R and S. For example, the vertex of an angle is the point where the two edges of the angle intersect, and a vertex of a cube is simply one of its corners—of which there are 8. The concept of vertex applies to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometrical objects. For example, a tetrahedron has 4 vertices, and a pentagon has 5 vertices.
Vertex figure	In geometry, a vertex figure is the that results when a corner of a polyhedron or polytope is sliced off.
Vest	A vest is a kind of clothing. It is worn on the upper part of the body. It has no sleeves. In the United States and American English, a vest is a kind of clothing sometimes worn on top of a shirt. In Britain and British English, a vest is a kind of clothing worn over the chest and below all other clothes on that part of the body.
Victim blaming	Victim blaming is holding the victim of a crime responsible for that crime. Starting in the 1970s, the term was commonly used in the United States. It was mainly used in connection with Criminal trial for rape, as well those with a racism background. In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascism character".<ref>James Martin Harding (1997) Adorno and "A writing of the ruins": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture, p.143 quotation: "The mechanisms of this ideology affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the World War II—at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, "bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities" (Adorno "Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler" 158)."</ref>Shortly after, Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley created their influential and highly debated F-scale (personality test) (F for fascist), published in The Authoritarian Personality (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak." A common example of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.
Vigilantism	A vigilante is a civilian or organization acting in a law enforcement capacity (or in the pursuit of self-perceived justice) without legal authority.
Vijayanagara architecture	The Vijayanagara Empire built all of their buildings, monuments, shrines and statues out of stone which were very intricately and elaborately carved with designs of gods and stories of famous heroes. All these were built in Dravidian style which was a common style of building then
Villa	A villa was originally a style of house built for the upper classes in ancient Rome. This style of architecture has been kept and adapted upon. The villas in Italy have gradually evolved into luxurious houses. Today, the word villa can refer to many types and sizes of houses around the world. A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper-class country house. Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa has evolved considerably.

Villain	A villain is a evil person in fiction. The word comes from a Latin word meaning a Feudalism farm worker or peasant. Villains, or antagonists, are usually found in fiction, such as books and movies. The audience do not usually like the villain and they support the hero or heroine. However, in some cases the villain is more praised by the public than the hero, as the example of Joker (comics) in the Batman franchise. In some movies and books (such as the movie Ocean's Eleven), the villain is a good person and the hero/heroine is bad (such as a robber). When used in comic books, they are as Supervillain. Supervillains usually hold some kind of unnatural force.
Vineyard	A vineyard is a place where grapes are grown. Some vineyards belong to winery. The grapes grown in those are used to make wine.
Vintage clothing	The term vintage clothing means clothing from a previous time.
Virtual community	A virtual community is a community who share an interest, hobby or idea.The people in it may come from many different places.They talk with each other using technology, such as the Internet, telephone, text, video calls and email.
Virtual private network	A virtual private network, or VPN is a set of Technology which are used to link computers to create a private network. Another network is used to carry the data, which is Encryption. The carrier network will see the packets of data which it routes. To the users of the VPN, it will look like the computers were directly connected to each other. The VPN model can guarantee the following:
Virtuoso	A virtuoso is someone (usually in the performing arts) who is an expert in his or her field. A musical virtuoso is one who plays a musical instrument very well. Musicians who have exceptional talent and can play extremely fast and difficult music are "virtuosi" (plural of "virtuoso"). In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was a virtuoso violin as well as a composer. Franz Liszt was a virtuoso piano and composer. Musicians may sometimes talk about “virtuoso music” meaning music which is so difficult that only a virtuoso could play it.
Visual poetry	Visual poetry is poetry in which the typographical arrangement of words and images is important in conveying the intended effect.It was influenced by Fluxus, the international artistic Movement of the 1960s, well known for blending different disciplines and artistic media.
Vitruvian Man	The Vitruvian Man is a drawing made by Leonardo da Vinci in about 1490. Around the drawing are notes based on the work of the architect Vitruvius. The drawing is done in pen and ink on paper. It is of a male figure standing in two positions, that are Superimposition (drawn over the top of each other). The figure's arms and legs are drawn in two different positions, while the rest of the body stays in one position. The figure is drawn standing inside both a circle and a square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man. It is stored in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy. It is displayed only occasionally. The drawing is based on the ideal proportions of a man's Physique, and how this relates to geometry. This relationship was described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De architectura. Vitruvius wrote the human figure was the main source of proportion among the Classical antiquity orders of architecture. He wrote that the ideal body should be eight heads tall. Da Vinci's drawing is traditionally named in honour of the architect.
Voice of America Persian News Network	Voice of America-Persian News Network (VOA-PNN) is a governmental international broadcaster of the United States. It broadcasts in the Persian language. Its base is in Washington D.C.. Its first program was broadcasted on 18 October 1994. The duration of its first programs was at first one hour. The first VOA radio programs in Persian were broadcast on 22 November 1979. They lasted at first 30 minutes.
Voice-over	A voice-over is a technique used in movies, television, theater, and many other types of presentation. When voice-over is used, the sound of the voice is used over other images. The character doing the voice-over is not seen.
Volatiles	In planetary science, volatiles are the group of chemical chemical element and chemical compound with a low boiling point. They are often found in the Crust (geology) or atmosphere of a planet or moon. Examples of volatiles are nitrogen, water, and ammonia.
Volatility	In economics, the term volatility is used to measure how much the price or value of an economic Good (economics) or service changes over time. Goods or services where the price changes a lot are said to have a high volatility, those that don't have a low volatility. The word come from the Latin verb "volare" meaning "to fly". In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts. In statistical terms, volatility is the standard deviation of a market or security’s annualised returns over a given period - essentially the rate at which its price increases or decreases. Historical volatility is calculated using a series of past market prices, while implied volatility looks at expected future volatility, using the market price of a market-traded derivative like an option.
Voltage	Voltage is what makes electric Charged particle move. It is the 'push' that causes charges to move in a wire or other electrical conductor. It can be thought of as the force that pushes the charges, but it is not a force. Voltage can cause charges to move, and since moving charges is a current, voltage can cause a Electric current. Electric Potential Difference is the true scientific term but is commonly called Voltage. Informally, voltage or electric potential difference is sometimes called "Potential Difference". Voltage is also called, in certain circumstances, electromotive force (EMF). Voltage is an electrical potential difference, the difference in electric potential between two places. The unit for electrical potential difference, or voltage, is the volt. The volt is named in memory of Alessandro Volta. One volt equals one joule per coulomb. The symbol for the unit volt is written with an uppercase V as in (9V). According to the rules of the International System of Units, the symbol for a unit with a name derived from the proper name of a person is uppercase. Please note that the volt and voltage are two different things. The volt is a Unit of measurement by which we measure something. Both electric potential and voltage are things we measure and the volt is the unit of measure for both. The symbol for the unit volt is written with a V (9 volts or 9 V). When voltage is used in a formula, it can be typeset in italics, e.g., V=9\,\text, or written in cursive. If there is only a single letter symbol to go by, a lowercase v may be used, e.g., \text = \text \times \text or \text = \text. Electrical engineers use the symbol e for voltage, e.g., e=ir, to make the difference between voltage and volts very clear. Technically, the voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points and is always measured between two points. e.g. between the positive and negative ends of a battery, between a wire and the ground, or between a wire or a point of a circuit and a point in another part of the circuit. In everyday use with household electricity in the U.S. the voltage is most often 120V. This voltage is measured from the electric wire to the ground. Note that there must be both voltage and current to transfer power (energy). For example, a wire can have a high voltage on it, but unless it is connected, nothing will happen. Birds can land on high voltage lines such as 12kV and 16kV without dying, because the current does not flow through the bird. There are two types of voltage, direct current voltage and Alternating current voltage. The DC voltage (direct current voltage) always has the same polarity (positive or negative), such as in a battery. The AC voltage (alternating current voltage) alternates between positive and negative. For example, the voltage from the wall socket changes polarity 60 times per second (in America) or 50 times per second (UK and Europe). The DC is typically used for electronics and the AC for motors.
Voltage regulation	In electrical engineering, voltage regulation is a measure of the difference in voltage between the sending and receiving ends of a electric power transmission or electric power distribution. On one end of these systems is the source, where the power is received, and on the other end is the Electrical load, where the power is sent to. Voltage regulation involves measuring the difference in the voltage at each end. Electric utility companies use some electrical equipment to maintain the voltage constant magnitude value transmitted or distributed along the power line, such as tap changer, voltage regulator, capacitor etc.
Voltage spike	A voltage spike is a sudden increase in voltage value over a short time in Electrical power. It can be caused by several factors, but mostly it is due to Fault (power engineering). A voltage spike might cause an increase in Electric current, but the increase in voltage might have been caused by the current increase as well.
Voltammetry	Voltammetry is the name for a number of methods to analyse a sample, both in terms of quality and quantity. With voltammetry, the composition of a probe can be re-constructed by looking at the way electrical currents flow through it. Usually, the electrical current between two or more electrodes is varied. Voltammetry is a form of electrolysis.
Vomitorium	A vomitorium is a hallway or alcove found in Ancient Rome. It is called a vomitorium because it can allow many, many people to enter or leave the building at the same time. The word in Latin means "place from which things spew forth," or "place that things come out of quickly."
Vomitoxin	Vomitoxin is a group name for many natural poisons made by fungi from the genus Fusarium. These fungi grow on grains, such as wheat, rice, barley, and corn. The vomitoxin can stay in the grain. Things made out of the grain, such as flour, beer, or other food, may have vomitoxin in them. If humans or other animals eat the food, they can become sick with vomiting, dizziness, pain, and other problems. These problems usually stop after some time.
Voting	Voting is when a group of people decide something by saying what they want. It can be for Election a leader or representative, passing a law, and other things. When people are done voting, the votes are counted (often by machines) and the winner is determined. Voting can be done in small groups (friends deciding what to do over weekend), societies (building committee deciding on whether to paint a building), nations (voting for president or - in some cases - voting for independence) and global (United Nations deciding how to limit nuclear weapon development). Usually the side that gets most votes will win. This is called majority rule. The right to vote is called suffrage. In some cases, a certain percentage may be needed to win a vote. This is often the case when voting to change the constitution of a country, or when electing a government official. When choosing a government official, there may be several rounds. In the first round, votes can be cast for all candidates. In the second round, only the two or three candidates with the most votes can be chosen.Voting is done in democratic government.
Voxel art	Voxel art is a digital art form which is similar to pixel art. Instead of coloring Square, Cube are colored. Voxel art is especially popular in revamps of old video games, and also in Minecraft and other cube sandboxes. Voxel art is made with special software called a voxel editor.
Voyeurism	Voyeurism is when a person gets sexual pleasure from the fact that they can see other people doing things that are normally private, such as getting undressed, or being naked, or having sex. The people being watched are usually not aware of the voyeur (watcher). Voyerurism is an important concept in movie. Some movies can be voyeuristic, even if they do not have sex or nudity in them.
Wage theft	Wage theft is when employers illegally hold back money due to their workers (employees). They may withhold wages or deny that are rightfully due to an employee. It is a term used in the in the United States, but the idea applies more widely. Examples are: failure to pay overtime, paying less than the minimum wage, illegal deductions in pay, working off the clock, or not being paid at all. Wage theft from low wage immigrants is common in the United States. The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year. The rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In February 2010 Miami-Dade County, Florida became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft. Before that, wage theft was called "the crime wave that almost no one talks about".
Waistline (clothing)	The waistline is the part of a piece of clothing that sits on the wearer's waist. The actual position of the waitline can be different depending on the fashion or how the person chooses to wear the garment, but it is normally just above the hips. Waistlines can be secured with a variety of methods, such as buttons, knots and zippers. A waistband is a strip of elastic rubber that adjusts to keep the item tight against the body.
Waits	Waits or waites were United Kingdom town musicians. From medieval times up to the early 19th century, every important Great Britain town and city had a band of waites. Some other countries in Europe also had waits. They were called Stadtpfeifer in Germany and Pifferi in Italy. The duties (things they had to do) varied in different towns and at different times in history. One of their most important jobs was to play at certain times of day so that people knew what the time was. They often played from the top of church towers. Sometimes they were also guards, watching from the towers so that they could spot any danger. They were like watchmen, making sure everything was all right (there was no police at that time). They woke people up in the mornings by playing music in the streets. The instruments they played also varied. Mostly they were loud wind instruments such as the shawm. It was a paid job. The waits wore smart livery and silver chains of office with the town's coat of arms. In Germany the Stadtpfeifer would also play at church service. They would play shawms or trombone on normal days, but trumpet and drum on feast-days. In Britain there were no more waits after 1835. The name “waits” is still used in “Christmas Waits” (any group of people singing Christmas carol at Christmas).
Wallace Line	The Wallace Line (or 'Wallace's Line') is a boundary that separates the ecozone of Asia and the Australasian ecozone. The transitional zone is sometimes called Wallacea. Plants and animals related to Asian species are found to the north-west. Australasian species are found mainly to the south-east, with some Asian species. The line is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noticed this clear dividing line during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century. The line runs through Indonesia, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes); and through the Lombok Strait between Bali (in the west) and Lombok (in the east). The distance between Bali and Lombok is only about 35 kilometers. Surprisingly, the distributions of many bird species observe the line, because many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water. Some bats have distributions that cross the Wallace Line, but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other; an exception is the Crab-eating Macaque. Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns, but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent. The term 'Wallace's Line' was first used by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1868.<ref name=Mayr44/>
Warranty	In commercial and consumer transactions, a warranty is an obligation that an article or service that is sold has the quality the buyer can reasonably expect from the seller. That often means that there must be a remedy. That means repair or replacement if the article or service is not as good as the warranty says. It is a breach of the warranty when the promise is broken, i.e., a product is defective or not as good as should be expected by a reasonable buyer. In business and legal transactions, a warranty is an assurance by one party to the other party that certain facts or conditions are true or will happen. The other party is allowed to rely on that assurance and seek some type of remedy if it is not true or followed. A warranty may be express or implied.
Warsaw Convention	distinguish the Warsaw Pact, which was a defence treaty between Eastern European nations The Warsaw Convention is an international convention which regulates for international carriage of persons, luggage or goods performed by aircraft for reward. It was signed in 1929 in Warsaw, it was amended in 1955 at The Hague and in 1975 in Montreal, Quebec. In particular, the Warsaw Convention has the following rules:
Water gardens	A water garden is a garden in which the chief thing, interest, and attraction is water and plants that live in water. The water may be put in a fountain, a pond, a waterfall, or other. Water have been built for thousands of years. It was natural that in the hot places of Egypt and Mesopotamia refreshing water gardens should be found. As early as 1225 BC, Ramses III built water lily ponds. The Inca of Peru built gold and silver water channels, pools, and basins as early as 2500 BC. Their homes and palaces had water running in channels under the floors to cool the surrounding air. Their courtyards had cooling pools for tired travelers. The Chinese and Japanese imitated nature in their water gardens. The water garden was a sign of perfection and peace. By the third century AD they had written down the essentials of a water garden. In the 15th century, they turned the water garden into an art form that used the sound and motion of water. A reflecting pool expressed the union of heaven and earth. The Japanese built a dry garden, using small rocks, sand, and other materials to represent the course of a stream or river. Nature was recreated to serve as a source of thinking. Europeans began using water for playing in the Middle Ages. Springs and wells were made focal points in gardens. Carp pools not only provided food, but a place for thinking and resting in monastery. In Spain, the starkness of the Alhambra was softened with canals and pools.
Water turbine	A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water. Water turbines were developed in the nineteenth century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids. Now they are mostly used for electric power generation. They harness a clean and renewable energy source.
Watermelon stereotype	The Watermelon stereotype is the stereotype view that black people can be made happy easily; they only need a watermelon and a little rest for their happiness. The stereotype was perpetuated in minstrel shows often depicting African Americans as ignorant and workshy, given to song and dance and inordinately fond of watermelon. This stereotype is common in the United States, and probably goes back to the times of slavery: The people who were in favour of slavery wanted to show that black people were simple-minded and only needed few things for their happiness.
Watershed (television)	Today, television can show a number of programmes. Usually the content of these programmes is rated, by a number of people (usually called advisory board). Some of the programmes may be suitable for children (of different ages), other content may not be suitable for children. The watershed is the time of the day where content not suitable for children may be shown. This is usually during the night (starting in the later evening, and ending in the early morning)
Weak key	In cryptography, a weak key is a key (cryptography) which when used with a specific cipher, makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way, and simplifies breaking (cracking) the ciphertext. Weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall key space, which means that if someone generates a random key to encrypt a message, it is a rare condition that weak keys will cause a security problem. However, it is considered a good design for a cipher to have no weak keys ("quality chiper"). A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a flat, or linear, key space.
Weathering	Weathering is the breaking down of Rock (geology) rocks, soil and their minerals through direct contact with the Earth's atmosphere, waters, or living things. It is a natural process. Weathering occurs in one place with little or no movement, and should not be confused with erosion which is when rocks and minerals are moved to another place by ice, water, wind or gravity.
Web accessibility	Web accessibility is how easy it is to use the internet for people with disabilities. This can be different types of disabilities. For example, websites might have important information in a sound file with somebody reading it out loud, which would make it possible for people who are blind or who have trouble seeing to get the information. Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights, because such images could give some people seizures.
Web application	A web application is a software application that can be run without being installed on the client and that has several parts: A part of it will run on the remote Web Server, another part will run on the client, usually inside a web browser. Both parts communicate over a computer network, for example the internet. The protocol they often use is called Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This kind of application design is called Client-server. The parts are usually called "tiers". The most common kind is a three-tier application: One tier is called Presentation tier, another is called Application tier, and the third is called Storage tier. Common examples of web applications are those used for Webmail, or for online banking. Social media sites, such as Wikipedia are also web applications.
Web hosting service	A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service. It allows people and company to make their website available on the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies which provide space on a server (computing) which is owned or leased for use by clients. These clients store their Web site on the server. The server feeds the web pages to the Internet. Wikia, for example, is a hosting service. Many web hosting companies also provide other services including file hosting service.
Web portal	An internet portal or web portal is a website used to enter the Internet. It can also be used to describe a website to enter certain parts of the Internet, like Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. Many ISPs have their own portals, but there are many other portals by other companies, like Microsoft's MSN, Ask.com, and Yahoo!.
Web resource	A web resource is anything that can be ed from the World Wide Web. Some examples are web pages, e-mail, information from databases, and web services. Web resources have changed since the Internet was first created. The early concept was of static (non moving) Computer file or documents. The meaning of the term now has a wider use to include nearly everything that can be obtained via the Internet. Uniform resource locators or URLs, are used to identify a resource on the web.<ref name=Heckmann28/>
Web services	A Web service is defined as "a [[:en:Software_system|software system]] designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network". Web services are frequently just Web APIs that can be accessed over a network, such as the Internet, and executed on a remote system [[:en:Hosting|hosting]] the requested services. The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems, but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the HTTP used on the Web. Such services tend to fall into one of two camps: Big Web Services and Representational state transfer Web Services. "Big Web Services" use XML messages that follow the SOAP (protocol) standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise. In such systems, there is often a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint, but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in many Java (programming language) and .NET SOAP frameworks (frameworks such as Spring, Apache Axis2 and Apache CXF being notable exceptions). Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service. More recently, RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity, particularly with Internet companies. These also meet the W3C definition, and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP-based services. They do not require XML messages or WSDL service-API definitions.
Webcam	A webcam is a video camera that connects to a computer, and can let people see each other over the Internet. Most people that have webcams use them with an instant messenger to see each other at the same time. Webcams can also be used for recording videos and blog. The webcam can be part of a computer, mobile phone or it can be an independent device.
Webcast	A webcast is a type of media Computer file used on the Internet. It is distributed using streaming media technology to many people at the same time. It is basically the same as broadcasting over the internet. Many radio and TV stations, as well as stations that are only on the internet, have webcasts. Businesses may have webcasts to give presentations or to teach people. Some people broadcast weddings or funerals through webcasts.
Weber-Fechner law	The Weber–Fechner law is a proposed relationship between the Magnitude (mathematics) of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel.
Webmail	Webmail (or Web-based e-mail) is an e-mail service which is usually accessed through a web browser, instead of an email client such as Microsoft Outlook. Some well known versions are Gmail, Windows Live Mail and Yahoo! Mail. One of the advantages of using web-based e-mail, as with other Cloud computing is that users needn't have their own computer. They can access and write their mail from anyone else's computer that has a web browser connected to the internet.
Webpage	A webpage (or web page) is a document from the internet which can be seen with a web browser. Web pages each have a URL or address, which is how a page is found, and is different for every page. When a webpage is part of a larger group of pages managed by a company, person, or organization, it is part of a website. Pages can have words, pictures, videos, and links. Links are ways to get to other web pages. For example, this article is a webpage. It has the URL https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpage, and is part of the Wikipedia website. It has words and links. The links in this page are shown in blue and can be clicked to go to other webpages.
Wedding officiant	A wedding officiant is a person who is allowed by the government to perform weddings. This person may be a civil service, or they may hold a religion position (for example, a priest or a rabbi). In some countries, certain religious officials are automatically allowed to perform weddings. In other countries, they must first ask permission from the government. Wedding officiants who work for the government must often follow special rules, that others do not have to follow. For example, the government might not allow them to refuse to perform a wedding, if the people who want to get married are allowed to by the law. Some countries allow anyone, not just civil servants or religious officials, to become wedding officiants temporarily. A temporary wedding officiant is usually allowed to carry out only one specific wedding that they asked permission for. If they want to perform another one, they have to ask the government for permission again.
Wellington boot	Wellington boot is a type of boot, popularized by Anglo-Irish soldier and general Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Wellington boot is waterproof and is made from rubber. These boots are usually worn in wet weather, especially in autumn time. They protect from Puddle.
Wernicke's area	Wernicke's area is an area of the brain. It is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex linked to speech (the other is Broca's area). It is involved in the production of written and spoken language. It is in Brodmann area 22, in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. The dominant hemisphere is the left in about 95% of right handed individuals, and 60% of left handed individuals. As with Broca's area, Wernicke's area was discovered by autopsy of patients who had speech difficulties. Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist, had a patient who could speak quite well, but was unable to understand the speech of others. After the patient's death, Wernicke found damage to an area at the upper portion of the temporal lobe, just behind the auditory cortex. He thought, correctly, that this area was responsible for speech comprehension. This kind of aphasia is known as Wernicke's aphasia, or receptive aphasia.
Wet chemistry	Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that in the liquid Phase (matter). It is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench.
WhatsApp	WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware and cross-platform messaging and voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc.. The application allows the sending of text messages and voice calls, as well as video calls, images and other media, documents, and user location. The application runs from a mobile device though it is also accessible from desktop computers. The service requires consumer users to provide a standard cell phone telephone number. Originally users could only communicate with other users individually or in groups of individual users. In September 2017 WhatsApp announced a forthcoming business platform which will enable companies to provide customer service to users.
White City of Tel Aviv	The White City of Tel Aviv (, ) is the name of the Bauhaus (also called "internatioanl style") architecture area in Tel Aviv. After the 1920s eclectic architecture period in Tel Aviv, in the 1930s a new architectural style came to the city by Jewish-Germany architects. They brought the new style of the bauhaus to parts of the city. In 2003, these areas of Tel Aviv were declared a World Heritage Site by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for their unique architecture, under the name: White City of Tel Aviv. In 2000, the Tel Aviv Bauhaus Center opened in Dizengoff Street and in 2010 the Tel Aviv Bauhaus Museum opened in Bialik street next to the old City Hall.
WiFi Map	WiFi Map is a multifunctional utility and travel application that allows users to find free wifi hotspots for fast and secure internet connection. The app offers ability to purchase VPN access as well as eSim data plans on eligible iOS devices. WiFi Map company also offers access to its database for other developers via API/Software development kit integrations. WiFi Maps database includes millions of hotspots that were added via means crowdsource, thanks to the efforts of its extensive worldwide user base and business venues. The app has been downloaded more than 100 million times and has millions of monthly active users. WiFi Map LLC has been registered as a Delaware LLC, in May 2014. Company founders Denis Sklyarov, Igor Goldenberg, Dzmitry Plashchynski and Kirill Kudin (Kudin subsequently left the company in 2015).
Wide area network	A world wide area network, or WAN, is made up of several computer networks connected together, often over the Internet. In most cases, the networks in WANs all belong to the all same company or school.
Wiki	A wiki is a type of a website that lets anyone who can access the wiki create and change its webpage. The word is Internet slang. The word wiki is short for WikiWikiWeb. Wikiwiki is a word from the Hawaiian language, meaning "fast" or "speed". Examples of wikis include Wikipedia, Everipedia, Citizendium, [[:en:Scholarpedia|Scholarpedia]] Conservapedia, Wiktionary and Wikibooks. Every wiki can be changed, or edited, by anyone who has an account on the wiki, or by everyone in the world if the wiki allows it. Some important pages can only be changed by certain users. Wikis are central places where we all can share information, people can add new information, and then people read them. Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected. On a wiki, people can write pages by collaboration. Pages are watched closely to see whether changes are good or bad. If one person writes something wrong, another can correct it. Other users can also add something new to the page. Because of this, the page gets better when people change it. Administrators can block someone from editing if they vandalism, or for other reasons.TUsers can also discuss things on wikis. Discussion can help people understand things better and get a chance to tell their views. In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that, but in some wikis, the article and the discussion are in the same page. Wikis can be used for different things; not all wikis follow the same rules for using them. For example, the purpose of Wikipedia is to write s for an encyclopedia. That is why in Wikipedia, people do not want general discussion that does not help in writing articles. Ward Cunningham started the first wiki in March 1995. Many people liked it, and wrote there, after which they started similar websites. MediaWiki is the most used software for wikis. JSPWiki is one of many others. "Wiki" is also sometimes an abbreviation for Wikipedia.
Wild man	The Wild Man is a legendary creature that painters and artists in Middle age would put in their artwork. He was always shown as man covered with hair. The image of the wild man were used for Coat of arms, especially in Germany. Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy added wild men, wild women and wild families to art (for example, Albrecht Dürer or Hans Holbein the Younger).
Wildfire	Wildfire is a general term which includes forest fires, grassland fires, bushfires, brush fires and any other vegetation fire in countryside areas. Wildfires occur in every continent except Antarctica. They can occur naturally and spontaneously, but many are caused by humans, accidentally or deliberately. Fossil records and human history show that wildfires do occur at intervals. The Great Oxygenation Event and the spread of land plants made Earth a planet of fire. Wildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life, but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas. Some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction, Strategies of wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression have varied over the years. One of the more controversial methods is controlled burn: People permit or light small fires to burn away some of the fuel for a potential wildfire. While some wildfires burn in remote forested regions, they can cause extensive destruction of homes and other property in the zone between developed areas and undeveloped wilderness.
Wildlife	Wildlife originally meant non-domesticated animal species. It now includes all plants, fungi and other organisms which grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet. It has had a big effect on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all Ecosystem. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most developed Urban area sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. Most scientists agree that wildlife around is affected by human activities. A garden is not a natural habitat, but it is full of genuine wildlife.
Wildlife management	Wildlife management is a general term for the process of keeping wild species at desirable levels as determined by wildlife managers. Wildlife management can include game keeping, wildlife conservation and pest control. Wildlife management has become an integrated science using disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results. Wildlife conservation aims to halt the loss of species. It does this by taking using ecological principles to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people. Most wildlife is concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, irrigation, Coppice and hedge laying. Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the wellbeing of game birds. It may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book Game Management, Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use".
Wind chimes	Wind chimes are chimes that are made up of tubes, rods, bells or other objects that are made of wood or metal. Wind chimes are usually hung outside of someone's house near a garden. Wind chimes makes sounds when the wind blows the tubes, rods and bells. In popular music, wind chimes can be used for harmony music.
Windows Task Manager	Windows Task Manager is a task manager application. It is part of the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems. Windows Task Manager gives detailed information about computer performance and applications that are currently running. It also gives information about process (computing) and CPU usage, commit charge and memory information, network activity and statistics, logged-in users, and Windows service. The application can be used to set process priorities, processor affinity, forcibly terminating (ending) processes. In Windows XP only, the application can be used to shut down, restart, hibernate or log off from Windows.
Wingspan	The wingspan of an airplane or a bird is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The wingspan of an aircraft is always measured in a straight line, from wingtip to wingtip, independently of wing shape or Swept wing. To measure the wingspan of a bird, a live or freshly dead specimen is placed flat on its back, the wings are grasped at the wrist joints and ankles, and then the distance is measured between the tips of the longest primary feathers on each wing.
Wireless Application Protocol	The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a protocol. It was made to allow devices like mobile phones to access the internet.
Wit	Wit is a form of intellectual humour. A wit is someone skilled in making witty remarks. A witty remark is a smart observation, put with humor and said in the perfect moment. Forms of wit include: the quip and the repartee. Witty remarks may be intentionally , and perhaps more ingenious than funny. A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer. (Wilde: "I wish I'd said that." James McNeill Whistler: "You will, Oscar, you will".) [[es:Ingenio (desambiguación)]]
Witenagemot	The Witenagemot or Witan was an institution in Anglo-Saxons England, from about the 7th to the 11th century. The name is Old English and means council of the men. Originally, Witan was the plural of wita (the wise man); but it was used as a singular. The council was similar to the Germanic assembly called Thing (assembly). The purpose of the Witenagemot was to give an opinion about the administration and the organisation of the kingdom. They talked about how law should develop. They elected or confirmed the king. The Witenagemot also had the power to depose a king. This happened when they deposed Sigeberht of Wessex in 755. They also deposed Æthelwald Moll of Northumbria in 765.Witans were held at least once a year; usually more often. In many respects they were similar to modern-day Parliament of the United Kingdom. Unlike Parliament, the locations where they were held changed; neither the Witans nor the king had a permanent place to stay. When the Normans Norman conquest of England England in 1066, they replaced the Witenagemot with another institution. This institution was still known as Witan or Witenagemot until the 12th century.
Word of mouth	Word of mouth is the passing of information from a person to one or more people in conversation. In the past, it referred only to speech, but now, it can sometimes include Internet communication. It can be as simple as telling someone what time it is, or it can involve longer stories and news. It is a good way to share information about things that are of interest to a local community, such as businesses, Gossip, and Oral history.
Word salad	Word salad is language with meaningless, scrambled words. It is a "confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases". 'Word salad' is most often used for a symptom of a neurology or mental disorder. The words may or may not be grammatically correct. The key thing is that a listener cannot get any meaning from them. The term is often used in psychiatry and theoretical linguistics to describe language which native speakers judge is meaningless.
WordPress	WordPress is a piece of software which has become the most widely used content management system and is used for setting up blogs. It is open source, licensed under the GPL, and written in PHP. WordPress allows users to create and edit websites through a central administrative dashboard, which includes a text editor for modifying content, menus and various design elements. WordPress provides plugins which provide additional functionality through WordPress Plugin Directory. There are over 54,000+ Plugins available in WordPress repository, and they can be installed through either upload or by one-click installation through the WordPress Plugin Library. Users can write posts into the software and other people reading the post can write comments about it. Since the release of WordPress version 4.7 the software had been downloaded more than 36+ million times.

World Architecture Festival	The World Architecture Festival is an international festival dedicated to architecture. The festival started in 2008 in Barcelona. It has since then has been held in Singapore.
World IPv6 Day	World IPv6 day was an event on January 12, 2011. On World IPv6 day, many websites tested IPv6, the new version of the "Internet protocol". There was another event on June 6, 2012 called "World IPv6 Launch Day". On World IPv6 Launch Day, the Internet Society hoped that IPv6 would really be d and work on many websites.
World Wide Web Consortium	The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an organization created by Tim Berners-Lee, in order to continue the development of the web, and its languages. Tim Berners-Lee also wants to make standards for the languages, and to improve them. As of 2 April 2010, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 328 Members. As of 29 March 2012, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 351 members. As of 9 June 2014, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 384 Members.
Write Anywhere File Layout	Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL) is a file system. It was developed with large RAID arrays in mind. After a failure, the RAID array can be directly restarted. Other features like making the filesystem bigger without taking it offline are also supported.
Wrongful death claim	Wrongful death is a Cause of action against a person who may be held Legal liability for another person's death. A wrongful death lawsuits may be based on claims of negligence, misconduct, or a criminal act such as murder. If the person accused of causing a wrongful death is charged with a crime, the wrongful death lawsuit may be filed after a criminal trial. It is possible to win a wrongful death lawsuit even if the person is acquitted of a crime that caused the death, because even though both trials may use the same evidence a wrongful death case has a lower standard of Evidence (law).<ref name="wrongdeath1"/><ref name="FindLaw" /> The claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close Family, based on Tort. Common law did not allow for wrongful deatlh lawsuits, as the right to bring a wrongful death claim belonged to the deceased person and died along with that person. In the United States, States of the United States and Federal government of the United States laws now allow for wrongful death cases in all U.S.jurisdictions.<ref name="nolo"/>
X Window System	The X Window System is a set of protocols and computer program. It is also known as X11, or simply X. It can manage windows, and other components of a graphical user interface on a bitmap display. This way of doing graphics is most common in UNIX operating systems. X provides the basic components to build GUI environments: drawing and moving window (computing) on the screen and interacting with a mouse or a keyboard. X does not say what the user interface should look like different client programs handle this. Different X11-based environments have radically different designs. X is not a part of the operating system; instead, it is built as an additional program on top of the operating system. Unlike previous display protocols, X was specifically designed to be used over computer network connections rather than on a display near the computer. X has network transparency: the machine where an application program (the client application) runs need not be the user's local machine (the display server). X was developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984. The current protocol version, X11, appeared in September 1987. The X.Org Foundation leads the X project, with the current reference implementation, version 11 release 7.7 (6 June 2012), available as free software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses.
X-Forwarded-For	The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header is a standard for finding the IP address of a client connecting to a server through an HTTP proxy server or load balancer comes from.
X-ray astronomy	X-ray astronomy is a field of astronomy that analyzes the x-rays coming from space. Most x-rays are filtered by earth's atmosphere so x-ray astronomy is usually done with telescopes that are on satellites in space such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
X-ray crystallography	X-ray crystallography is a way to see the 3D structure of a molecule. The electron cloud of an atom bends the X-rays slightly. This makes a "picture" of the molecule that can be seen on a screen. It can be used for both organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry molecules. The sample is not destroyed in the process. The technique was jointly invented by Sir William Bragg (1862–1942) and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg (1890–1971). They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson , Francis Crick , Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin in February 1953. The oldest method of X-ray crystallography is X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern. These patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal.
XSL attack	In cryptography, the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers. The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk. It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher faster than a brute force attack. Advanced Encryption Standard is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information. Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the Ciphertext without having the Key (cryptography) could cause wide damage. In 2004 it was shown by one of the Cryptanalysis, that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper. In addition, the method requires long effort. Unless shortened, the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack. Therefore, it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future. However, the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES. The XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internal design of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic polynomial simultaneous equations. These systems of equations are typically very large, for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES. Several methods for solving such systems are known. In the XSL attack, a specialized algorithm, termed XSL (eXtended Sparse Linearization), is then applied to solve these equations and Computation the key (cryptography). The attack is well-known and famous for requiring only a handful of Known-plaintext attack to perform. Previous methods of cryptanalysis, such as Linear cryptanalysis and differential cryptanalysis, often require unrealistically large numbers of known or Chosen-plaintext attacks, which make them impossible to realize.
XSP (software)	XSP is a simple, standalone server written in C Sharp (programming language). It hosts ASP.NET's System for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. As well as running on the Mono (software) runtime for Linux it also runs on the Microsoft .Net runtime. This makes it usable as a light weight web server on any .NET supporting platform. XSP was originally the name of the internal project at Microsoft that became ASP.NET. The name is a homage to the original name of what became ASP.NET XSP is also a term for the eXtensible Server Pages technology in Apache Cocoon.
Xerophile	Xerophiles are extremophile organisms that can grow and reproduce in conditions with almost no water. Many moulds and yeasts are xerophilic. Mould growth on bread is an example of food spoilt by a xerophilic fungus. Examples:
Yacouba Sawadogo	Yacouba Sawadogo is a farmer from Burkina Faso, a country in West Africa. He has been using a traditional farming technique called Zaï to help soil damaged by drought. He is notable for spreading an improved soil and water conservation practice in Burkina Faso.<ref name=kabore/>
Year of the Rabbit (TV series)	Year of the Rabbit is a British sitcom. Keeley Hawes plays in it.
Yellow-dog contract	A yellow-dog contract (a yellow-dog clause of a contract, or an ironclad oath) is an agreement between an employer and an employee. The employee agrees not to be a part of a trade unions. This was part of a contract which employers and employees signed when employees were hired. In the United States, yellow-dog contracts or yellow-dog clauses were often used by employers to stop the creation of unions. It let employers take lawsuit against union organizers. In 1932, yellow-dog contracts were Law of the United States in the United States under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The term yellow-dog clause can also have another meaning: non-compete clauses inside of or added to a non-disclosure agreement to stop an employee from working for other employers in the same industry.
Yemenite architecture	Yemenite architecture is the name of the Architecture style of Yemen from the Pre-Islamic period until the Islamic period. today. Particularly notable in this style is the design of the buildings in which Islam began to spread in this country. This style of architecture is mainly characterized by the construction of mud bricks and residential buildings in the form of tall towers and sometimes even large boulders intertwined between dwellings. in southern Saudi Arabia some of villages close to the border of Yemen are having an architectural style similar to Yemen.
Yield	In economics, the yield is how much money somebody is paid each year for leaving his or her money investment somewhere. Unlike a corporation dividend, a yield is fairly certain, unless there is a bankruptcy. This means that somebody usually knows how much money they are going to make from their yield ahead of time. Yields can be different because of inflation. However, there is usually an order for which are most risky and which are the least: the least risky instruments, such as treasury bonds, yield the least, then safe and "guaranteed" instruments like long-term deposits, then overnight deposits, and so on to the various municipal bond and corporate bonds. Extremely risky instruments with high yield are usually called junk bonds.
Yield (chemistry)	In chemistry, yield (also called chemical yield or reaction yield) is the amount of Product (chemistry) resulting from a chemical reaction. The absolute yield gives the weight in grams, and the molar yield gives the number of Mole (unit). The fractional yield, relative yield, or percentage yield shows how completely a Chemical synthesis worked. It is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the theoretical yield (the unit of measurement for both must be the same): To get the percentage yield, one must multiplication the fractional yield by 100% (e.g., 0.673 × 100% = 67.3%). The percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100%, but it cannot be d because measurements are never completely accurate. Yields around 100% are "quantitative", yields above 90% are "excellent", yields above 80% are "very good", yields above 70% are "good", yields above 50% are "fair", and yields below 40% are "poor".<ref name=vogel/>
Yuzu (emulator)	Yuzu, stylized as yuzu, is a Free and open-source software Video game console emulator of the Nintendo Switch. Yuzu was announced to be in development on January 14, 2018, 10 months after the Nintendo Switch came out. It is developed in C++. The emulator is made by the developers of the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra (emulator). Both programs use a lot of the same code. At first, Yuzu only supported test programs and Homebrew (video games), but as of July 2019, a small amount of games work without any issues. A list of games that work with Yuzu is updated on Yuzu's official website.
Zaiger's Genetics	Zaiger's Genetics is an United States company that breeds fruit trees. They are in Modesto, California, California. They have created fruits such as the Aprium (apricot and plum), the Nectarcot (nectarine and apricot), Peacotum (peach, apricot and plum) and the pluot (plum and apricot). They are dedicated to improving fruit worldwide. In 2009 Floyd Zaiger was named one of the "top ten most creative people in food" by Fast Company. Zaiger's Genetics gives fruit tours to commercial growers every Wednesday. An article in Western Fruit Grower titled "Wednesdays With Floyd" described a typical Wednesday with the Zaiger family.
Zaï	Zaï is a technique used in agriculture. Holes are dug in the soil to catch water. They have been used in the western Sahel area to make soil healthier and grow more plants. Yacouba Sawadogo, a farmer from Burkina Faso, is bringing back zaï holes. He came up with the idea of filling them with manure and compost as food for plants. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help further break up the soil. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Zaï holes help trees, sorghum, and millet make up to 500% more food or wood.
Zeeboids	Zeeboids is an application that allows Avatar (computing) to be created. It was developed by Zeebo Interactive Studios in Brazil, and was only released for the Zeebo. Zeeboids works with Zeebo Football Club (F.C.) games such as Zeebo F.C. Foot Camp, allowing players to create custom characters ("avatars") and participate in online rankings.
Zero tolerance	The term zero tolerance refers to automatic reprimand or punishment for even mild violations of certain rules. The policy forbids when people of even the highest position change punishment policy or rules. Punishments set earlier are not always severe. Those with sexual harassment or bad Internet uses are usually harsh. The first recorded use for the term was 1972, though it might have been used earlier. In certain schools, zero tolerance applies to any knife regardless of its type. Credible evidence, though, does not support zero tolerance rules having positive effects. In fact, suspensions may result in embarrassment to schools and students or even bad publicities. The policy has gotten criticized for violating Law Enforcement Codes.
Zero-coupon bond	A zero-coupon bond is a special Bond (finance), where there are no periodic interest payments. At the end of the runtime, it will be repaid at the agreed value. There may be compensation for inflation. Usually, zero coupon bonds have long runtimes.
Zero-knowledge proof	A zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a protocol used in cryptography. In such a protocol, two parties are communicating. The task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret, but without revealing the secret.
Zipper	This article is about the fastening device called the zip. For information on the acronym ZIP, please see that article.
Zombie bank	A zombie bank is a special case of a zombie company. It is a financial institution that has a net worth of less than zero. Usually, such companies file for bankruptcy. Like a zombie company, the zombie bank is still able to pay the short-term liabilities (such as the interest on its Loan). It doesn't have enough money to repay the loans, though. If the Interest rate are low, this will help zombie banks. Zombie banks, like zombie companies can be saved from bankruptcy, but usually they need a large (and costly) reorganization. The term zombie bank (and zombie company) was first used to refer to a period of Japanese economy, in the 1990s: This period is known as Lost Decades, today.
ZoneAlarm	ZoneAlarm is a Firewall (networking) originally developed by Zone Labs, which was acquired in March 2004 by Check Point. It includes an inbound intrusion detection system, as well as the ability to control which programs can create outbound connections—the latter not available in the Windows XP Service Pack 2 firewall. , the newest release is ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2009. ZoneAlarm was formerly known as Zone Labs, the usage of which is declining.
